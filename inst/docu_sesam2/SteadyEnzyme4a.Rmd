The SEAM and SESAM3 model microbial turnover first order to microbial biomass.
A fraction of the turnover is mineralized due to predation.

# Scaling turnover rate with pool size
We hypothesize that increasing the predation turnover rate with microbial biomass
in SESAM4 helps to avoid the unreasonable long priming time scales observed with these 
models.

There are now three microbial turnover fluxes.

- turnover by predation: $\operatorname{tvr}_{B,pred}$
- turnover by starvation, i.e. uptake < enzyme synthesis + maintenance: $\operatorname{tvr}_{B,starv}$
- turnover by other causes: $\operatorname{tvr}_{B}$

$$
\begin{align}
\operatorname{tvr}_{B,pred} &= \tau_P (B-B_0) B \\
\operatorname{tvr}_{B,starv} &= min(0, -\operatorname{syn}_B) \\
\operatorname{tvr}_{B} &= \tau B \\
\end{align}
$$

Parameter $B_0$ ensures that predation ceases if microbial biomass is too scarce.

If C available for biomass synthesis is negtive, current microbial biomass becomes
a source for enzyme production and associated catabolic requirements and for maintenance respiration.


## Tests
simplified model with $\tau = 0$ and $B_0 = 0$.

# Differential stoichiometry of lysed cell material
Moreover, SESAM4 explicitly models the return of mircobial turnover to DOM and 
to re-uptake. This shortcut C flux has not been explicitly presented in SEAM and SESAM3
because it just scaled the parameters: turnover rate $\tau$, 
catabolic C use efficiency $\epsilon$ with QSS for DOM where uptake equals DOM input fluxes

SESAM4 implements different stoichiometry of lysed cell material returned to DOM and of 
cell wall more C rich material transferred to residue pool, $R$. In order
to mass balance all element, the explicit flux is now necessary.

If the stoichiometric E:C ratios of biomass, $\beta_B$, and cell wall material,
$\beta_W$, and the fraction of cell wall material, $c_W$ are given, the 
stoichiometic ratio of the lysed material can be computed as:

$$
\begin{align}
\beta_B B = c_w \beta_{W} B + (1 - c_w) \beta_L B \\
\beta_B = c_w \beta_W + (1 - c_w) \beta_L \\
\beta_L = \frac{\beta_B  - c_w \beta_W}{ (1 - c_w)} \\
\end{align}
$$
