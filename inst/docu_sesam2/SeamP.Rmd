title: "SEAM phosphorous equations"

The SEAM2 model only considered C and N limitation. 
Here we report equations for phosphorous (P) analogous to the N equations
and extend the other equations.

We need to assume in a first approximation, that depolymerization of SOM delivers
P in a stoichiometric ratio equal to that of the SOM. Further we neglect storage of
P inside microbial biomass. Assimilated P is incorporated into biomass or mineralized.

# Phosphorous fluxes
P fluxes and pools are derived by dividing the respective fluxes with the
C/P ratio, $\gamma$, of their source.

It follows the derivation of N fluxes with replacing the C/N ratio, $\beta$, by
C/P ratios, $\gamma$, and N mineralization/immobilization flux $\Phi$ by 
P mineralization/immobilization flux $\Phi_P$.

The C/P ratios $\gamma_B$ and $\gamma_E$ of the microbial biomass and 
enzymes are assumed to be fixed. However, the C/P ratio of the substrate pools
may change over time and thus the substrate P pools are modelled explicitly.
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dL_P}{dt} &=  - \operatorname{dec}_L /\gamma_{L} +
\operatorname{input}_L/\gamma_{\operatorname{i}} 
\\
\frac{dR_P}{dt} &=  - \operatorname{dec}_R /\gamma_{R} +
\epsilon_{\operatorname{tvr}} \operatorname{tvr}_B /\gamma_{B} + \notag 
\\
& \qquad (1 -\kappa_E) (\operatorname{tvr}_{ER} +
\operatorname{tvr}_{EL})/\gamma_{E} 
\\
\frac{dI_P}{dt} &= +i_{IP} -k_{IP} -l I_P +\Phi_P
\\
\Phi_P &= \Phi_{Pu} +\Phi_{PB} + \Phi_{P\operatorname{tvr}}
\\
\Phi_{Pu} &= (1 -\nu_P) u_{P,OM}
\text{,} 
\end{align}
$$

\noindent where the balance of the inorganic dissolved P pool $I_P$ sums
inorganic inputs $i_I$,e.g. by weathering, plant uptake $k_{IP}$, leaching $l I$, 
and the exchange flux with soil microbial biomass, $\Phi_P$. The latter is
the sum of the P mineralization outside microbial cells, $\Phi_{Pu}$, mineralisation-immobilisation imbalance flux,
$\Phi_ {PB}$ (\ref{eq:PhiPB}), and mineralisation of a part of microbial
turnover ,$\Phi_{P\operatorname{tvr}}$ (\ref{eq:PhiTvr}, section \ref{sec:Tvr}).

Organic P uptake, $u_{P,OM}$, was modelled as a parallel scheme (PAR),
where a part of the depolimerized organic P that is assimilated by microbial biomass, and the other part is mineralised.
Potential P uptake is the sum of organic P uptake and the potential
immobilisation flux ($u_{\operatorname{imm,Pot}}$). Uptake from DOM is assumed
equal to influxes to DOM times the apparent P use efficiency $nu_P$.

%\label{eq:uP}
$$
\begin{align}
u_P &= nu_P u_{P,OM} + u_{P\operatorname{imm,Pot}}
\\
u_{P,OM} &= \operatorname{dec}_L/\gamma_L + \operatorname{dec}_R/\gamma_R +
\kappa_E (\operatorname{tvr}_{ER} + \operatorname{tvr}_{EL})/\gamma_E
\\
u_{P \operatorname{imm,Pot}} &= i_{PB} I_P 
\text{,}
\end{align}
$$
where C/P ratios $\gamma_L$ and $\gamma_R$ are calculated based on current C
and P substrate pools: $\gamma_L = L/L_P$.  

The P available for biomass synthesis is the difference of microbial P
uptake and expenses for enzyme synthesis. This translates to a P
constraint for the C used for biomass synthesis and its associated
catabolic growth respiration: $C_{\operatorname{synB}} \le
C_{\operatorname{synBP}}$.

\label{eq:synBN}
$$
\begin{align}
P_{\operatorname{synBP}} &= u_P - \operatorname{syn}_E/\gamma_E \text{,} \\
C_{\operatorname{synBP}} &= \gamma_B \, P_{\operatorname{synBP}}  / \epsilon
\end{align}
$$
