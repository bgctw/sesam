\section{Revenue strategie's rational \label{app:revenueRational}}    
%% Appendix A

This section explains the rational in a bit more detail, why
the allocation proportional to the revenue is optimal from a community
perspective.

For a single microbe it would be optimal to maximise growth by investing all
resources in that enzyme that maximises the return per investment for the
currently limiting element. Hence, it should allocate all resources to the
enzymes yielding the maximum revenue.
However, if many microbes compete for the same best substrate, they also have to
share the return of the extracellular decomposition process. If another microbe
targets the second-best substrate by producing a different set of enzymes, it
does not need to share the returns. When taking this competition
into account, it makes sense to allocate the most resources for the best revenue but also some
resources to the other possibilities. Hence, the revenue strategy allocates
resources proportional to their revenue.
