\section{Rationale behind the revenue strategy \label{app:revenueRational}}    

This section explains the rationale in a bit more detail, why
the allocation proportional to the revenue is optimal from a community
perspective.

For a single microbe it would be optimal to maximise growth by investing all
resources in that enzyme that maximises the return per investment for the
currently limiting element. Hence, it should allocate all resources to the
enzymes yielding the maximum revenue.
However, if many microbes compete for the same best substrate, they also have to
share the return of the extracellular decomposition process. If another microbe
targets the second-best substrate at a different location by producing a
different set of enzymes, it does not need to share the returns. When taking
this competition into account, it makes sense to allocate the most resources for
the best revenue but also some resources to the other possibilities. Hence, the
revenue strategy allocates resources proportional to their revenue.
