% In order to understand the coupling of global (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, it

necessary to understand C and N use efficiencies of microbial soil organic
matter (SOM) decomposers. While important controls of those efficiencies by
microbial community adaptations have been shown at pore scale, an abstract
simplified representation of community adaptations is needed at ecosystem scale.
Therefore we developed the soil extracellular enzyme allocation model (SEAM)
that described C and N dynamics at ecosystem and decadal scale.
We explicitely modeled several alternative community adaptation strategies of
resource allocation to extracellular enzymes and enzyme limitations on SOM
decomposition. Using SEAM, we explored the effects of those alternative
strategy-hypotheses on SOM and inorganic N cycling.
Simulations showed that the revenue enzyme allocation strategy was most
competitive, which accounted for adaptations to both, stoichiometry and amount
of different SOM resources.
Predictions of the holistic SEAM model were qualitatively similar to microbial
group explicit models with the ability to represent priming effects, and the
buildup or decline of SOM pools depending on inorganic N inputs.
We found that soil enzyme allocation strategies strongly affect long term soil
organic matter cycling and nutrient recycling.
The findings imply that ecosystem scale models should account for adaptation of
C and N use efficiencies to represent and understand C-N couplings. The
combination of stoichiometry and optimality principles is a promising route to
yield simple formulations of such adaptations at community level suitable for
incorporation into land surface models.
