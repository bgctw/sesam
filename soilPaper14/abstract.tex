In order to understand the coupling of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, it is
necessary to understand C and N-use efficiencies of microbial soil organic
matter (SOM) decomposition. While important controls of those efficiencies by
microbial community adaptations have been shown at the scale of a soil pore, an
abstract simplified representation of community adaptations is needed at
ecosystem scale.
Therefore we developed the soil enzyme allocation model (SEAM), which takes a
holistic approach to describe C and N dynamics at the spatial scale of an
ecosystem and time-scales of years and longer.
We explicitly modelled community adaptation strategies of resource allocation to
extracellular enzymes and enzyme limitations on SOM decomposition. Using SEAM,
we explored whether alternative strategy-hypotheses can have strong effects on
SOM and inorganic N cycling.
Simulations showed that the revenue enzyme allocation strategy, which accounts
for microbial adaptations to both, stoichiometry and amount of different SOM
resources, was most viable with allowing largest microbial biomass under a wide
range of conditions.
Predictions of the SEAM model were qualitatively similar to models explicitly
representing competing microbial groups with respect to the ability to represent
priming effects, and the buildup or decline of SOM pools depending on inorganic
N inputs. With adaptive enzyme allocation strategies N was made accessibe, which
was formerly locked in slowly degrading SOM pools if C/N ratio of litter inputs
increased, wheras N was sequesterd in SOM and protected from leaching if N
inputs increased.
The findings imply that it is important for ecosystem scale models to account
for adaptation of C and N use efficiencies in order to represent C-N couplings.
The combination of stoichiometry and optimality principles is a promising route
to yield simple formulations of such adaptations at community level suitable for
incorporation into land surface models.
