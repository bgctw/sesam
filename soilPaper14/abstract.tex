In order to understand the coupling of \remarkSZ{}{global} (C) and nitrogen (N)
cycles, it is necessary to understand C and N-use efficiencies of microbial soil
organic matter (SOM) decomposition. While important controls of those
efficiencies by microbial community adaptations have been shown at the scale of
a soil pore, an abstract simplified representation of community adaptations is
needed at ecosystem scale.
Therefore we developed the soil enzyme
allocation model (SEAM), which takes a holistic approach to describe C and N
dynamics at the spatial scale of an ecosystem and time-scales of years and
longer.
We explicitly modelled community adaptation strategies of resource allocation to
extracellular enzymes and enzyme limitations on SOM decomposition. Using SEAM,
we explored whether alternative strategy-hypotheses can have strong effects on
SOM and inorganic N cycling.
Simulations showed that the revenue enzyme allocation strategy, which accounts
for microbial adaptations to both, stoichiometry and amount of different SOM
resources, was most \remarkSZ{competitive}{(not sure this is the right word)}.
Predictions of the SEAM model were qualitatively similar to models explicitly
representing competing microbial groups with respect to the ability to represent
priming effects, and the buildup or decline of SOM pools depending on inorganic
N inputs.
We found that soil enzyme allocation strategies strongly affect \remTW{more
specific} long-term soil organic matter cycling and nutrient recycling. The
findings imply that it is important for ecosystem scale models to account for adaptation
of C and N use efficiencies in order to represent C-N
couplings. The combination of stoichiometry
and optimality principles is a promising route to yield simple formulations of
such adaptations at community level suitable for incorporation into land surface
models.
