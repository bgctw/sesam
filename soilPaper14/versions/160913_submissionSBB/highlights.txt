SEAM, a model of soil organic matter (SOM) cycling is presented.

Microbial community adaptation of enzyme production is modeled in an abstract holistic manner. 

Simulated rhizosphere priming effects allow plants to liberate nitrogen (N) from SOM under N limitation.

Continuous carbon (C) and N sequestration with high inorganic N inputs is simulated at the Laquille pasture site.

Strong effects of decomposer community adaptation on C and N use efficiencies are shown. 

Optimality is promising approach for scaling up microbial processes to ecosystem SOM models.
