The global element cycles of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are strongly linked and
cannot be understood without their intricate interactions
\citep{Thornton07,Janssens10, Zaehle11}.
The ties between nutrient cycles are especially strong in the dynamics of soil
organic matter (SOM), because the depolymerisation and mineralisation of SOM
relies on a microbial decomposer community with a rather strict homeostatic
regulation of their stoichiometry, i.e. their elemental ratio of C/N \citep{Sterner02,
Zechmeister15}. Therefore, it is important to represent effects of microbial
control on soil biogeochemistry also in ecosystem to global scale models
\citep{Todd-Brown12, Xu14}.  

% %somehow misses an introduction saying that this paper is about the "correct"
% way to deal with this in ecosystem models.
Imbalance fluxes of C and N comprise portions of respiration of organic C,
mineralization of organic N, and immobilization of inorganic N. They occur if
decomposers experience stoichiometric imbalance, i.e. differences in elemental
composition between food and the requirement of feeders \citep{Sterner02}.
Decomposers require a certain amount of C for each unit of N.
With balanced growth, i.e. when stoichiometry of the food matches
the requirements, decomposers can utilize all food for productive
purposes such as synthesis of new biomass or enzymes, growth respiration, and maintenance
respiration. If there is different amount of C per unit N in the food,
decomposers have to deal with this imbalance.
 
Decomposers can - in principle - adjust in three different ways when faced with
imbalances between the stoichiometry of the organic material (OM), i.e. the
litter and SOM they feed on, and their own stoichiometric requirements
\citep{Mooshammer14}.
% are they not two separate things? % is the concept of these efficiencies clear
% to everyone?
First, individual microbes can adapt their carbon-use efficiency (CUE), or their
nutrient-use efficiency \citep{Sinsabaugh13}. The alteration of CUE has
shown to have large consequences on prediction of carbon sequestration in SOM
\citep{Allison14a, Wieder13}.
Regulation of nutrient use efficiency has consequences for nutrient recycling
and loss of nutrients from the ecosystem \citep{Mooshammer14a} and soil plant
feedback \citep{Rastetter11}.
Second, decomposer communities can adapt their stoichiometric requirements.
Community composition can shift between species with high C/N ratio, such as
many fungi, or species with lower C/N ratio, such as many bacteria
\citep{Cleveland07, Xu13}, although the flexibility is relatively narrow.
Third, decomposers can adapt their allocation of resources into synthesis of
different extracellular enzymes to preferentially degrade fractions of SOM that
differ by their stoichiometry \citep{Moorhead12}. 

Representation and consequences of stoichiometry on element cycling differ
between models at different scales. Most models at ecosystem scale employ the
first decomposer imbalance option, and use changes in CUE or nutrient use
efficiency to represent stoichiometric controls on respiration and mineralization fluxes
\citep{Manzoni08}. However, modelling studies at the pore scale have
demonstrated the important effect of community adaptation and their emerging
effects on element cycling \citep{Allison05, Resat11, Wang13}. Explicit
representation of competition among several microbial groups that differ in
their expression of different enzymes resulted in a comparable simulated CUE
across a wide range of litter stoichiometry \citep{Kaiser14}. Likely, therefore,
there is a need to capture the effects of community adaptation also in models at
ecosystem scale.

At least two alternatives exist to represent the effects of microbial diversity
at the ecosystem scale. First, competition of several microbial populations can
be explicitly modelled to represent stoichiometric effects such as sustained
sequestration of N with high N inputs \citep{Perveen14}. Second, adaptation of
effective properties of the entire microbial community, such as investments into
nutrient uptake \citep{Rastetter97, Rastetter11} can represent the emerging
effects in an abstract, but dynamic and adaptive way. The adaptation of enzyme
allocation was recently formalised using the second imbalance strategy by the
conceptual EEZY model \citep{Moorhead12} and further developed using the EnzMax
allocation strategy by \citet{Averill14}.
While these models show strong strategy effects on nutrient cycling in time
scale of days to months, they do not represent feedback mechanisms to the size
and stoichiometry of the SOM pools, and therefore they cannot study the
consequences for decadal SOM dynamics.

In this paper, we adopt the second alternative of representing microbial
diversity as working hypothesis and propose a holistic scheme to represent
effects of microbial adaptation of enzyme synthesis on SOM cycle at the
ecosystem scale. Our aim was to tackle the need of capturing the decadal time
scale effects of adaptive enzyme synthesis on SOM dynamics and nutrient
recycling. We therefore extended the EEZY model to explore different
consequences of alternative enzyme allocation strategies.

This paper first introduces the SEAM model (Section \ref{sec:SEAM}), a dynamical
model of SOM cycling that explicitly represents microbial strategies of
producing several extracellular enzyme pools (Section
\ref{sec:AllocStrategies}). Next, the effects of those strategies on SOM cycling
are presented by prototypical examples (Sections \ref{sec:SimScen} and
\ref{sec:ResultsProto}).
Finally, a calibration to an intensive pasture site (Section
\ref{sec:methodsPasture}) demonstrates the usability of the model (Section
\ref{sec:ResultsPasture}) and compares its predictions to the ones of the
Symphony model \citep{Perveen14}, which explicitly models several
microbial-groups. 

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Soil Enzyme Allocation Model (SEAM)}
\label{sec:SEAM}

The dynamic Soil Enzyme Allocation Model (SEAM) allows exploring consequences of
enzyme allocation strategies for SOM cycling at the soil core to ecosystem
scale from monthly to decadal scale. The modelled system are C and N pools in
SOM in a volume of soil. The system could be soil of a
laboratory incubation or a layer of a soil profile, e.g. its upper 20~\unit{cm}.
The model represents different SOM pools containing C and N as state variables
and specifies differential equations for the mass fluxes. It is driven by C and
N inputs of plant litter (both above-ground and rhizodeposition), inorganic N
inputs from deposition and fertilisers, as well as prescribed uptake of
inorganic N by roots. SEAM computes output fluxes of heterotrophic respiration
and leaching of inorganic N.

Key features are: first, the representation of several SOM pools that differ by
their stoichiometry, and second, the representation of enzymes that degrade
specifically those SOM pools. The quality spectrum is modelled by two classes:
a C rich litter pool, $\operatorname{L}$, and a N rich pool that consists of
microbial residues, $\operatorname{R}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:SEAMStruct}, Table
\ref{tab:modelStates}). The most important assumptions are described in the
following paragraphs, while the symbols are explained in Tab.
\ref{tab:modelParameters} and detailed model equations are provided with
\ref{app:SEAM}.

Decomposition of the litter and residue pools follows reverse
Michaelis-Menten kinetics \citep{Schimel03}, which is first-order to the amount
of OM, and saturates with the amount of the respective enzyme. C/N ratios,
$\beta$, of the decomposition flux are equal to the C/N ratios of the decomposed
pool. The C/N ratios of biomass and enzymes are assumed to be fixed, while those
of the substrate pools may change over time due to changing C/N ratio of total
influxes to these pools. Imbalances in stoichiometry of uptake and microbial
requirements are compensated by overflow respiration or N mineralization. This
means that if there is more C in uptake than can be used based on other
constraints, such as available N, it will be respired. If there is more N in
uptake than can be used by other constraints, such as available C, it will be
mineralized.
Total enzyme allocation is a fixed fraction, $a_E$, of the microbial biomass,
$B$, per time. However, the microbial community can use different strategies to
adjust their allocation to synthesis of alternative kinds of new enzymes
(Section \ref{sec:AllocStrategies}).
All decomposition fluxes first fuel a pool of dissolved OM (DOM). The dynamics
of this pool is usually much faster than the dynamics of the other pools.
Therefore, SEAM is simplified by assuming the DOM pool to be in quasi steady
state \citep{Wutzler13}. Hence, the sum of all influxes to the DOM pool, i.e.
decomposition plus part of the enzyme turnover, is taken up by the microbial
community and the DOM pool is not simulated explicitely.
If expenses for maintenance and enzyme synthesis cannot be met, the microbial
community starves and declines in biomass.

\subsection{Exchange with inorganic N pools}

%%it would have been easier to follow this section if equations were provided

The imbalance flux, $\Phi_B$ (\ref{eq:PhiB}), lets microbes mineralise excess N,
or immobilise required N up to a maximum rate, $u_{\operatorname{imm,Pot}}$. The
latter is assumed to increase linearly with the inorganic N pool.
While this stoichiometric imbalance flux is the most widely implemented flux
mechanism between microbial biomass and the inorganic N pools in SOM models
\citep{Manzoni09}, it is not sufficient to recycle N to the inorganic pool if
microbial biomass is itself N limited.
Therefore, two additional mineralisation fluxes are implemented in SEAM (Fig.
\ref{fig:SEAMStructNFluxes}). First, a fraction of microbial uptake N in DOM,
$\Phi_u$ (termed uptake mineralisation), is mineralised to represent the
subscale imbalance flux at C-limited spots of a heterogeneous soil volume, which
is in total not C-limited \citep{Manzoni08}.
Second, a fraction of microbial turnover is mineralised that accounts for
grazing. Grazers respire a fraction of the grazed biomass C to meet their energy
demand, and - assuming invariant grazer stoichiometry  - must release an
equivalent amount of nutrients.
This mineralization component, here termed turnover mineralization
$\Phi_{\operatorname{tvr}}$, has been formalised in the soil microbial loop
hypothesis \citep{Clarholm85, Raynaud06}.

\begin{figure}[t] \vspace*{2mm}
\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{fig/seam_NFluxes} 
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{fig/seam_NFluxes} 
\end{center}
\caption{
In addition to the maybe negative imbalance flux, $\Phi_B$ of microbial biomass,
$B$, there are additional mineralization fluxes feeding the inorganic pool, $I$,
due to mineralization during uptake, $\Phi_u$, and mineralization during
microbial turnover, $\Phi_{\operatorname{tvr}}$ adding up to total
mineralization/immobilization flux $\Phi = \Phi_u + \Phi_B +
\Phi_{\operatorname{tvr}}$.
The N dynamics depends also on fluxes across the system boundary, namely input of organic N with litter, input
of inorganic N $iI$, leaching, and plant uptake of inorganic N.
\label{fig:SEAMStructNFluxes}}
\end{figure}

In the light of the introduction of these additional N mineralisation fluxes, a
refinement of the term N limitation in modelling concepts (Table
\ref{tab:NutrientLimDefs}) is required.
When microbes cannot meet their stoichiometric demand by DOM uptake but can
meet their demand by immobilising inorganic N, we suggest the term 
\textit{organic N limitation}.
When the immobilisation flux cannot meet the stoichiometric requirement of the
microbial community, we suggest the term \textit{microbial N limitation}.
Despite the maximum microbial immobilisation flux there might still be a net
mineralization in the system due to uptake mineralization and turnover
mineralization. When there is a net N
immobilizsation in the system, i.e. a net transfer from the inorganic pool to
the organic pools of SOM and microbial biomass, we suggest the term 
\textit{decomposer system N limitation}. While the two first terms are relevant
for microbial ecology, the last term is controlling N availability for plants.

\begin{tabular}{p{2.3cm}p{5.5cm}}

constrained by other elements (${\Phi_B < 0}$).
\\
Microbial N lim. & uptake of organic matter plus maximum immobilisation flux is
not enough to satisfy microbial N requirements (${-\Phi_B \ge
u_{\operatorname{imm,Pot}}}$).
\\

the organic pools (${\Phi = \Phi_B+\Phi_u+\Phi_{\operatorname{tvr}}<0}$).
\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{ Enzyme allocation strategies} 
\label{sec:AllocStrategies}

Microbes in SEAM allocate a proportion $\alpha$ of their total enzyme
investments, $a_e\,B$, to the synthesis of enzymes, $\operatorname{syn}_{E}$, targeting the
N-rich $R$ substrate and a proportion $1 - \alpha$ to the synthesis of enzymes
targeting the N-poor, but better degradable $L$ substrate.
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:alpha}
\operatorname{syn}_{E_R} /
(\operatorname{syn}_{E_R} + \operatorname{syn}_{E_L}) \equiv \alpha
\end{equation}

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Microbial enzyme allocation strategies \label{tab:AllocStrategies}}
\vskip4mm
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lp{6.5cm}}
\hline
Strategy &  Allocation is \\
\hline
Fixed & independent, constant \\
Match & adjusted to achieve balanced growth, i.e. $\beta_{DOM}$ matches
microbial demands  \\
EnzMax & equal to Match-Allocation if microbial N-limited, and
equal to $\alpha=0.5$ otherwise
\\
Revenue & proportional to return per investments into enzymes \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Four different strategies of
allocating investments among synthesis of alternative enzymes were explored in this study (Table
\ref{tab:AllocStrategies}).

The \textbf{Fixed} strategy assumes that allocation is independent of,
and not changing with changes in substrate availability.
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:allocFixed}
\alpha = \operatorname{const.} = 1/2
\end{equation}
This strategy corresponds to the models without enzyme allocation adaptation
where decomposition rate is a function of microbial biomass \citep{Wutzler08}.
 
The \textbf{Match} strategy assumes that microbes regulate enzyme synthesis in a
way that the decomposition products balance their stoichiometric demands
\citep{Moorhead12}. The partitioning coefficient $\alpha$ (\ref{eq:alpha}) is
derived by equating the C/N ratio of the sum of uptake fluxes after
other expenses, such as growth and maintenance respiration, to the
C/N ratio of microbial biomass, $\beta_B$. The equation of \citep{Moorhead12}
has been adapted to take into account inorganic N immobilization and to an
''anabolic'' microbial efficiency rather than an carbon use efficiency lumping
growth and maintenance respiration.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:allocMatchCN}
\beta_B = \frac{\epsilon (\operatorname{dec}_L + \operatorname{dec}_R - r_M)}{
\operatorname{dec}_L/\beta_L + \operatorname{dec}_R/\beta_R  - \Phi_M } 
\text{,}
\end{equation}
where $\operatorname{dec}_L$, and $\operatorname{dec}_R$ are depolymerisation
fluxes of the litter and residue pools, respectively (\ref{eq:dec}), which both
are a function of enzyme levels and, hence, indirectly a function of $\alpha$.
$r_M$ is maintenance respiration (\ref{eq:rM}), $\epsilon$ is the anabolic
microbial efficiency accounting for growth respiration (\ref{eq:synB}),
$\beta_i$ are C/N ratios of the respective pools $i$, and $\Phi_M$ is the net
flux of N from living microbes to the mineral N pool. Equation
\ref{eq:allocMatchCN} for simplicity neglects the small inputs of enzymes to
DOM. Here, we assume that microbes use the maximal immobilisation of inorganic
N, $u_{\operatorname{imm,Pot}}$ (\ref{eq:uN}) to meet their stoichiometric
requirements with the Match strategy.
Hence, the net N imbalance flux is the difference between mineralization during
uptake and the immobilisation:
$\Phi_M = \Phi_u - u_{\operatorname{imm,Pot}}$. With microbial N limitation,
(\ref{eq:allocMatchCN}) has no solution. In this case, the enzyme effort is
allocated entirely to the N-rich substrate ($\alpha=1$), and excess carbon
uptake is respired by overflow respiration.

If current enzyme pools $E_S$, are assumed to be in quasi steady-state with
their respective substrate $S \in \{L,R\}$ and microbial biomass, then equation
\ref{eq:allocMatchCN} can be solved for the partitioning coefficient, $\alpha$.

\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:allocMatch} 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:allocMatchM} 
\alpha_M &= f_{\operatorname{{\alpha}Fix}}(L,\beta_L,R,\beta_R, E_L, E_R, r_M,
\Phi_M)
\\
\alpha &= \begin{cases}
  0,  & \text{if} \alpha_M \le 0 \\
  1,  & \text{if} \alpha_M \ge 1 \\
  \alpha_M, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}   
\end{align}
\end{subequations} 
\noindent where the long equation (\ref{eq:allocMatchM}) is given with
supplementary material together with R-code and the SYMPY script of its
derivation.
The bound to one is necessary to handle the case of microbial N limitation. The
bound to zero corresponds to the theoretical case where the C-rich substrate may
not suffice to cover microbial C demands relative to N demands.

The \textbf{EnzMax} strategy \citep{Averill14} matches stoichiometry if microbes
are substrate N limited, and uses a fixed allocation coefficient $\alpha = 0.5$
if microbes are not substrate N-limited, i.e. C-limited. In order to avoid
freqent jumps between the two cases, a weighted mean between the two fluxes was
used for N imbalance fluxes near $\Phi_B=0$ with $\alpha$ approaching
the match solution (\ref{eq:allocMatchM}) for N mineralization or approaching $0.5$
for N immobilization indicating C limitation.

The \textbf{Revenue} strategy assumes that the microbial community adapts in a
way to ensure that the investment into enzyme synthesis is proportional to its
revenue, i.e.
the return per investment regarding the currently limiting element:

\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:allocRev}
\begin{align}
\alpha_C &= \frac{\operatorname{rev}_{RC}}{\operatorname{rev}_{LC} + \operatorname{rev}_{RC}} 
\\
\alpha_N &= \frac{\operatorname{rev}_{RN}}{\operatorname{rev}_{LN} + \operatorname{rev}_{RN}} 
\text{,} 
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
\noindent where $\operatorname{rev}_S$ is the revenue from given substrate $S \in \{L,R\}$
with microbial C and N limitation respectively. The revenue is computed on the
current status quo, i.e. the current enzyme levels. 
\ref{app:revenueRational} explains why investing proportional into all enzymes
is better than investing into the single best enzyme. The return is the current
decomposition flux from the substrate degraded by the respective enzyme
(\ref{eq:dec}), and the assumed investment balances enzyme turnover to keep
current enzyme levels, $E_S^*$ (\ref{eq:tvrE}).

% : $a_E B = k_{NR} E_R^* + k_{NL} E_L^*$.
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:allocRev2}
\begin{align}
\operatorname{rev}_{SC} &= \frac{\text{return}}{\text{investment}} 
= \frac{\operatorname{dec}_{S,Pot} \frac{E_S^*}{K_{M,S} + E_S^*}} {k_{E}E_S^*} 
= \frac{\operatorname{dec}_{S,Pot}} {k_{E}(K_{M,S} + E_S^*)} 
\\ 
\operatorname{rev}_{SN} &= \frac{\operatorname{dec}_{S,Pot}
\frac{E_S^*}{K_{M,S} + E_S^*} / \beta_S} {k_{E} E_S^* / \beta_E} 
= \operatorname{rev}_{SC} \frac{\beta_E}{\beta_S}
% \\
% = \frac{\operatorname{dec}_{S,Pot}}{k_{E} (K_{M,S} + E_S^*)} 
% \frac{\beta_E}{\beta_S}
\text{,} 
\end{align}
\end{subequations} 
\noindent where $k_{E}$ is rate of enzyme turnover, $K_{M,S}$ is the enzyme's
substrate affinity, $\operatorname{dec}_{S,Pot}$ is
enzyme saturated decomposition flux (\ref{eq:dec}), and $\beta$ are C/N ratios
of the respective pools. 

There are two resulting partitioning coefficients, $\alpha_C$ and $\alpha_N$
with C or N-limited microbial biomass, respectively. In order to avoid frequent large jumps
under near co-limitation, SEAM implements a smooth transition between these two
cases as a weighted average.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:allocRev3}
%\begin{align}
\alpha = \frac{w_{\operatorname{CLim}} \alpha_C + w_{\operatorname{NLim}}
\alpha_N}{w_{\operatorname{CLim}}  + w_{\operatorname{NLim}} } 
\text{,} 
%\end{align}
\end{equation}
where $w$ is the strength of the limitation of the respective element,
specifically the ratio of required to available biomass synthesis fluxes
(\ref{eq:weightsLim}).


\subsection{Prototypical simulation experiments} 
\label{sec:SimScen}

Several prototypical simulation experiments (Table \ref{tab:SimScen}) were used
to explore the consequences of the different microbial enzyme allocation
strategies (\ref{sec:AllocStrategies}) for the simulated SOM dynamics. They
increase in complexity from a soil incubation experiment to a decadal
\chem{CO_2} manipulation treatment.
All experiments used parameter values given in Table \ref{tab:modelParameters}
unless stated otherwise in this section. For the prototypical experiments,
the inorganic N pool was kept constant at $I=0.4~\unit{gN~m^{-2}}$, while
inorganic N feedbacks were considered in Section \ref{sec:methodsPasture}.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Prototypical simulation experiments \label{tab:SimScen}}
\vskip4mm
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lp{5.3cm}}
\tophline
Experiment & Explored issue\\
\middlehline
VarN-Incubation & Efficieny of using given fixed substrate levels that
vary by N content \\
Substrate-feedback & Possibility and size of steady state substrate pools\\
Priming & Increased substrate decomposition and mineralization after
a pulse addition of fresh litter\\
\chem{CO_2}-Fertilization & Continued increase of litter C inputs but
constant litter N inputs
\\
\bottomhline
\end{tabular} 
\end{table}

The \textbf{VarN-Incubation} experiment explored how efficiently substrates
of given a stoichiometry are used for microbial biomass growth with the
different enzyme allocation strategies. A simplified model version was used in
this experiment, where all the inputs and feedback to the substrate pools ($L$
and $R$) were neglected, and in which these pools were kept constant ($dL/dt =
dR/dt = 0$). This simplification led to a quasi steady state of microbial
biomass and enzyme levels for the given substrate supply. This experiment mimics
a short-term incubation experiment, where changes in litter and residue pools
are negligible small. The assumed boundary conditions for this experiment were
fixed substrate carbon of $L=100~\unit{gC~m^{-2}}$, and $R=400~
\unit{gC~m^{-2}}$. The C/N ratio of the residue pool was assumed constant at
$\beta_R=7$, whereas litter C/N ratio varied between 18 and 42 ($\beta_L =
[18,..,42]$).

The \textbf{Substrate-feedback} experiment explored the decadal trajectories of
the entire system including feedback to the substrate pools. Litter input was
assumed constant at a rate of $\operatorname{input}_L =
400~\unit{gC~m^{-2}yr^{-1}}$ with a C/N ratio of $\beta_{\operatorname{input}_L}
= 30$.

The \textbf{Priming} experiment explored the effect of rhizosphere priming, i.e
the input of fresh litter into a volume of subsoil that is newly explored by a
root. Specifically, the simulations evaluated the fluxes after an addition of
50~\unit{gC~m^{-2}} and a respective amount of N (C/N ratio
$\beta_{\operatorname{input}_L} = 30$) on a soil that otherwise received a
litter input of only 30 \unit{gC~m^{-2}yr^{-1}} (and respective N with
$\beta_{\operatorname{input}_L} = 30$) for a decade. The assumption is made that
the rhizodeposition litter input (both pulse and continuous) was very easily
degradable litter, specifically with a maximum turnover of $k_L =
10~\unit{day^{-1}}$. The amendment of rhizodeposition was simulated by a single
pulse, i.e. a step change in the litter pool.

The \textbf{\chem{CO_2}-Fertilization} experiment explored the effect of
increased continuous litter C input, which is expected with elevated atmospheric
\chem{CO_2} concentration.
The simulations started from steady state corresponding to initial litter C
input of $\operatorname{input}_L = 400~\unit{gC~m^{-2}yr^{-1}}$, applied 20\%
increased C inputs during years 10 to 60, and applied initial litter inputs
again during the next 50 years. The litter N inputs were kept constant over
time, implying an increase in the litter C/N ratio of 20\%. Litter input rate
was assumed constant across the year.

\subsection{Calibration to a fertilised pasture site}
\label{sec:methodsPasture}

To test the capacity of SEAM to simulate the net carbon storage of a pasture
site including feedback of the inorganic N pool, we calibrated the model to data
of an intensive pasture. The intensive pasture calibration was tackled only with
the Revenue strategy, because the Match and the EnzMax strategies had already
shown inadequate for scenarios including feedbacks to substrate pools during
in the Substrate-feedback experiment. The control case of the Fixed
strategy did not allow for adaptation of microbial enzyme allocation. 

The model drivers and most of the parametrisation and drivers (Tables
\ref{tab:modelParameters} and \ref{tab:modelStates}) were taken from
\citet{Perveen14}.
The site is a temperate permanent pasture located at an altitude of 1040m
a.s.l. in France (Laqueuille, 45\textdegree{38}'N, 2\textdegree{44}'E), receives
an annual precipitation of 1200~mm and has an annual mean temperature of  7
\textdegree{C}. 

The N-balance of the fertilised pasture is characterised by very high inorganic
N-inputs. A fraction of this N is sequestered in accumulating SOM, a fraction is
lost to leaching, while the remainder is exported with plant biomass harvest.
Plant uptake of inorganic N was computed as the sum of plant litter production
and plant biomass exports, keeping the plant N pool constant.
 
Model parameters were chosen corresponding to Table 1 in \citet{Perveen14}, and
initial litter and SOM pools were prescribed to observed values.
Three parameters were calibrated: the maximum decomposition rates
of substrate pools, $k_L$ and $k_R$, and the anabolic carbon-use efficiency,
$\epsilon$. Initial pools of microbial biomass and enzymes were set to the
decadal steady state in order to prevent large transient initial
fluctuations in model pools. The calibration used the \textit{optim} function
from R \textit{stats} package \citep{R07} and minimised the differences between model
predictions and observations normalised by the standard deviation of the
observations. The calibration used observations of the litter OM, the inorganic
N, leaching, and rate of change of the total SOM pool ($\approx dR/dt$ if $L$ is

\section{Results}

First, the results of several prototypical artificial simulation experiments
clarify the general behaviour and features of the SEAM model. Next, results of a
parameter calibration demonstrate the model's ability to
simulate the observed C and N dynamics of an intensive pasture and explore
feedbacks with the dynamics of the inorganic N pool.

\subsection{Prototypical simulation experiments}
\label{sec:ResultsProto}

Under the \textbf{VarN-Incubation} experiment, in which the substrate pools were fixed,
there were marked differences in the effect of allocation strategies on simulated biomass and the imbalance flux (Fig.
\ref{fig:VarNNoFeedback}).
 
\begin{figure}[t] \vspace*{2mm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{fig/VarNNoFeedback}
\end{center}
\caption{
VarN-Incubation experiment: The match enzyme allocations strategy yielded
highest resource efficiency, i.e. lowest mineralization fluxes (negative or
small N mineralization and at the same time no C overflow respiration) across a
large range of C/N ratios.
Microbes with alternative strategies, however, were more competitive as
indicated by a higher biomass. The patterns are caused by different adatption of
resource allocation ($\alpha$) affecting C/N ratio of the decomposition flux
(cnDOM) and carbon use efficiency (CUE).
\label{fig:VarNNoFeedback}} 
\end{figure}

The Match strategy allowed balanced growth, and yielded the highest substrate
efficiency and lowest mineralization fluxes among the enzyme allocation
strategies. Across a range of litter C/N ratios of 22 to 42 the match strategy
yielded non-positive imbalance fluxes, i.e. no mineralization of excess N or
overflow respiration of excess C. This means, that microbes could utilize all
food taken up for productive expenditures. However, the match strategy also
yielded lowest biomass aside from naarow C/N ratios among the strategies. In the
discussion we argue that this means an inferior strategy.

With the Revenue strategy, enzyme allocation $\alpha$ also varied with litter N
content, but to a lesser extent.
With litter containing enough N (low C/N ratio), still about 5\% of the enzyme
synthesis C expenditures were allocated into R-degrading enzymes. 
With high C/N ratio of litter, investment into R-degrading enzymes increased to
about 30\%, much less than with the Match strategy. Hence, the Revenue strategy
yielded higher overflow respiration associated with a low carbon-use
efficiency (CUE). However, it gained more of the limiting element N with the
decomposition flux and supported higher microbial biomass. 

The Fixed strategy yielded higher N-mineralization due to larger stoichiometric
imbalance at low C/N ratios.
At high C/N ratios its constant allocation coefficient was intermediate between
the other strategies, leading to intermediate values of all the other outputs.

The EnzMax strategy yielded predictions equal to the Match strategy with low C/N
ratios, equal to the Fixed strategy with high C/N ratios, and a transition
between those two at C/N ratios around 23.

% \remTW{ Threshold elemental ratio slightly increased with higher litter C/N
% ratio, as can be seen in the C/N ratio of the DOM in the match strategy. The
% reason for this increase, here, was a lower proportion of uptake flux compared
% to immobilization flux with lower biomass.}

When the substrate pools were allowed to be refuelled by microbial and enzyme
turnover with the \textbf{Substrate-feedback} experiment, both Fixed and the
Revenue strategies caused substrate pools to approach a steady state.
However, the microbes with Match strategy solely degraded the stoichiometrically
better matching N-rich residue pool, $R$. Hence, they declined together with the
residue pool despite the large amount of N accumulating in the
stoichiometrically less favourable litter pool, $L$, (Fig. \ref{fig:SimSteady}).
Similarly, with EnzMax strategy the litter pool accumulated until microbes
became C limited. Then there was an unreasonable explosion like increase of
microbial biomass, until this accumulated litter pool had been degraded.
Because of the Match and the EnzMax strategies yielded unreasonable behaviour
when including feedback to substrate pools in the model, they were omitted in
the following simulation experiments.

with the Match-strategy degraded the stoichiometrically matching but declining R
substrate pool and their biomass, B, declined despite the large N stores in
stoichiometrically less favourable litter, L. Note that the range of B and L has
been limited and does not display the unreasonably large values with the Match
and EnzMax strategies.
\label{fig:SimSteady}} 
\end{figure}

When the soil was amended with a pulse of litter with the \textbf{Priming
experiment}, a clear true priming effect, i.e. an increased decomposition of the
existing SOM, was simulated with the Fixed and Revenue strategy.
The priming effect occurred due to a strong enhancement of residue decomposition
(Fig. \ref{fig:PrimingMinDec} top). This enhancement was stronger with the
Revenue strategy than with the Fixed strategy, primarily because of a higher
simulated microbial biomass with the Revenue strategy. In consequence, also the
N-mineralization flux due to microbial turnover was larger with the Revenue
strategy (Fig. \ref{fig:PrimingMinDec} bottom).
Note, that the time scale of the simulated priming effect of more than 100 days
was longer than observed in priming experiments.

\begin{figure}[t] \vspace*{2mm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{fig/PrimingMinDec}
\end{center}
\caption{

and total N mineralization $\Phi$ were stimulated most strongly with the Revenue strategy

compared to a control with no amendment (thin horizontal lines).
\label{fig:PrimingMinDec}}
\end{figure}

When the continuous litter C input was assumed to be higher for 50 years with
the \textbf{\chem{CO_2}-fertilisation experiment}, enzyme allocation strategies
yielded marked difference in SOM stocks (Fig. \ref{fig:CO2Increase}) and
nutrient recycling (Fig. \ref{fig:CO2IncreaseImb}).
While litter stock, $L$, increased with both strategies following the increased
input, the residue stock, $R$, slightly increased with the Fixed strategy, but
declined strongly with the Revenue strategy. This was the consequence of an
increased mining of the $R$ pool with the Revenue strategy. Accordingly, N
mineralization was much stronger with the Revenue strategy during the elevated
\chem{CO_2} period, with the largest contribution from mineralization by
microbial turnover. In this experiment the microbes were organic N limited
($\Phi_B < 0$), but the decomposer system was not N limited, i.e. there was a
total N flux towards the plant accessible inorganic N pool ($\Phi_u + \Phi_B +
\Phi_{\operatorname{tvr}} > 0$). The adaptive Revenue strategy in effect helped
plants to liberate more N from SOM under elevated \chem{CO_2} in the following
way. There was a transfer from SOM R pool to living biomass and subsequently to
microbial turnover that was in part mineralized. The turnover of the increased
microbial biomass returned more N to the mineral N pool than taken up by
the immobilization flux of living microbes. The increased mineral N pool
then could be utilized by plants.
However, this response was transient. After litter inputs returned to initial
values, the system recovered towards the initial state but only on centennial
time scale that would even be longer if prescribing a longer turnover time for
slower SOM pools.

\subsection{Intensive pasture simulation}
\label{sec:ResultsPasture}

The calibrated SEAM model successfully simulated the observed C and N balance of
the Laqueuille intensive pasture (Figure \ref{fig:pastureFitMatch}). In contrast
to the prototypical simulation experiments, here, the feedback of the inorganic
N pool was included, the model was driven and compared to observed values, and
only the Revenue strategy has been considered.

The observed continuous build-up of an organic N pool in the residue SOM was
driven by the system's positive N balance. Two pathways caused the model
behaviour in SEAM. First, inorganic N was taken up by the plant and returned to
the soil via organic N in litter. Second, microbial biomass immobilised
inorganic N due to its stoichiometric imbalance with the substrate. The
microbial biomass was N-limited when only considering uptake of
organic substrate. However, it was C-limited when accounting for immobilisation
of inorganic N (Table \ref{tab:NutrientLimDefs}). 

\begin{figure}[t] \vspace*{2mm}

\caption{
Simulated dynamics after prescribed alteration of C and N inputs for Laqueuille
intensive pasture site: Shifts in enzyme allocation ($\alpha$) led to changes in
the evolution of organic and inorganic pools and N mineralization

Increased N substrate limitation, either due to elevated \chem{CO_2} or due to
decreasing inorganic N inputs, caused a decrease in mineral N pool, $I$. If the
substrate N limitation could not be balanced by inorganic N input, then the
change rate of the residue pool, $dR$, decreased down to negative values, i.e.
decreasing SOM pools.
\label{fig:pastureFitScen}}  
\end{figure}   
   
Simulated alteration of C and N inputs to the system strongly affected the
internal SOM and nutrient cycling. Effects were shown by several
simulation scenarios that started from the calibrated state but applied a step change in
inputs of litter or inorganic N (Figure \ref{fig:pastureFitScen}) as detailed
in following paragraphs.

Increased litter C input by 50\% together with an increased litter C/N ratio by
25\% (elevated \chem{CO_2} scenario) caused a shift in enzyme allocation towards
enzymes degrading the N-rich residue pool and an increase of the litter pool.
The higher input also increased the mineral N demand of both the plant to
balance increased biomass synthesis and the microbial biomass with its higher
stoichiometric imbalance. The resulting decrease in mineral N also decreased
leaching losses. Moreover, ecosystem available N was re-used more often, because
of a higher turnover flux of N in increased microbial biomass.

Decreased inorganic N inputs from 22.9
\unit{g~m^{-2}yr^{-1}} down to 1
\unit{g~m^{-2}yr^{-1}} together with a doubling of litter C/N
ratio caused a strong shift in enzyme allocation towards enzymes degrading the
N-rich residue SOM with similar consequences as with increased C input,
such as an increase in litter OM. However, in this scenario, the decreased N inputs caused
a depletion of the mineral N pool.
As a consequence, the microbial biomass could not use immobilisation to
balance substrate stoichiometry and became N-limited.
This caused overflow respiration and a decreasing trend in residue SOM. 

Increased inorganic N inputs from 22.9 \unit{g~m^{-2}yr^{-1}} up to 25.6
\unit{g~m^{-2}yr^{-1}} together with a decrease of litter C/N by 25\% did not
much affect the system behaviour, because the soil system was already C-limited
before. The microbial biomass could only immobilise a small fraction of
the additional N to build up new SOM. Instead, N accumulated in the inorganic
pool with associated increased losses to leaching.


\section{Discussion}
Microbial adaptation of enzyme synthesis to substrate availability benefited the
community so that higher microbial biomass levels could be sustained on a wider
range of substrate stoichiometry.
The different prototypic simulation experiments and the simulation of the
intensive pasture led to similar conclusions on the effects of adaptation of
enzyme allocation.

\subsection{Amounts of substrates matter}
The amount of substrate and the substrate stoichiometry are both important for
regulating enzyme allocation. The Match strategy failed to account for substrate
amount, assuming that microbes can achieve balanced growth under a wide range of
substrate stoichiometry \citep{Moorhead12, Ballantyne14}. This strategy yielded
lower microbial biomass both in the VarN-Incubation (Fig.
\ref{fig:VarNNoFeedback}) and in the Substrate-feedback experiments (Fig.
\ref{fig:SimSteady}). We argue that producing less biomass means an inferior
strategy, because slower growing microbes have a competitive disadvantage to
faster growing microbes that have otherwise same properties such as
maintenance requirements. Match-strategy microbes focused on degrading a
stoichiometrically balanced, but declining residues pool, leaving the large
amount of N available in a stoichiometrically less favourable litter pool
untouched (Fig. \ref{fig:SimSteady}).

The study of \citet{Averill14} also found that the best microbial allocation
strategy maximised growth instead of C or N use efficiency. It found that with C
limitation the best allocation would be strictly equal to all the enzymes.
However, the study did not yet consider feedbacks to the substrate pools, nor
immobilization of inorganic N. Moreover, it used a decomposition equation that
was completely independent of the amount of available substrate. The proposed
EnzMax strategy would allocate the same amount of resources to enzymes that
depolymerize a tiny substrate pool as to enzymes that depolymerize a large
substrate pool.
The EnzMax strategy was implemented in this study with a different decomposition
equation (\ref{eq:dec}). This combination led to unreasonable behaviour in the
Substrate-feedback experiment. During N limitation a large litter pool was built
up, and after microbes became C limited they grew explosive-like to unreasonable
high values until the accumulated amount of litter had been degraded (Fig.
\ref{fig:SimSteady}).

These findings imply that microbial enzyme allocation strategies should
account for substrate amounts.

\subsection{Community adaptation leads to a more efficient substrate usage}
The adaptive Revenue strategy consistently supported higher biomass and had
lower N mineralization fluxes at steady state compared to the non-adaptive
Fixed strategy with the VarN-Incubation experiment (Fig.
\ref{fig:VarNNoFeedback}). Similar patterns appeared with the other experiments
(Figs. \ref{fig:SimSteady} and \ref{fig:CO2IncreaseImb}). Such better substrate
usage is in line with results of individual based small-scale modelling
\citep{Kaiser14}.
The finding implies that N mineralization fluxes with imbalanced substrates may
be lower than inferred from previous modelling studies that did not account for
community adaptation.

\subsection{Comparison to observed changes in enzyme stoichiometry}
 
The SEAM model focuses on community adaptation of enzyme synthesis. It predicts
a change in the ratio of enzyme activities of enzymes degrading C-rich plant
litter versus enzymes degrading the N-rich residue SOM when changing inputs of
inorganic N to the soil.
While only low variation in stoichiometry of N-degrading versus C-degrading
enzymatic activity is observed across biomes \citep{Sinsabaugh09}, microcosm
studies detect short-term changes of enzyme activities with N fertilization
\citep{Kumar16}, but their observations differ between different kinds of
N-degrading enzymes. Hence, the evidence is mixed.

SEAM also predicts accelerated turnover of the residue pool associated with
increased enzyme activity of N-rich R-pool degrading enzymes after increased
inputs of litter C in relation to litter N.
Such patterns are observed at field scale at Duke forest, where
\citet{Phillips11} found an increased activity of extracellular enzymes involved
in breakdown of organic N associated with accelerated SOM turnover after
increased root exudation with elevated \chem{CO_2}. In an artificial
root exudation experiments at the same site, \citet{Drake13} found an increase of N
degrading NAG enzyme activity with C-only inputs and a shift from oxidative
towards hydrolytic enzymes decomposing low molecular weight (lmw) components
inputs that contained both C and N.
Assuming that the lmw-components have higher C/N ratios, this observed shift
is in line with SEAM predictions.

\subsection{SOM as nutrient bank}
Nitrogen was stored in residue SOM during periods of high N inputs and released
during periods of low N inputs relative to C inputs in simulations (Fig.
\ref{fig:CO2Increase}). When there was excess litter C, the microbial
community preferentially depolymerised, or mined, the N-rich residue pool, and thereby
made the N available for plants. When carbon inputs were low, microbes degraded
the residue pool to a lesser extent, but continued to build new residue via
microbial turnover. Hence, under low C conditions, the microbes kept N in the
decomposer system instead of releasing it through mineralisation.

This 'bank' mechanism \citep[sensu][]{Perveen14} also worked when simulating the
intensive pasture (Fig. \ref{fig:pastureFitScen}). During simulations of high
inorganic N inputs, N was sequestered in SOM at a high rate. With decreased
inorganic N inputs, the sequestration rate decreased until it became negative,
that is the N in slower decomposing SOM pools was mined. In the
long-term, i.e.
centuries, the inputs to the system have to balance the outputs of the system. Hence, in
the intensive pasture simulation, inorganic N pools and N leaching increased with
the increase of SOM with the SEAM model. The conservation or release of N by the
bank mechanism implies greater potential for ecosystems to avoid progressive N
limitation \citep{Norby10, Franklin14, Averill15}. This finding
potentially has consequences on feedbacks of global change, especially on the
projected C land uptake \citep{Friedlingstein14}.

\subsection{Priming effects liberate N}
Priming effects, i.e. the altered decomposition of SOM after soil amendments
\citep{Kuzyakov00}, are a potential mechanism to help plants stimulate N release
from the SOM for plant nutrition.
Priming effects and associated increased N mineralization were simulated for
both, the Fixed and Revenue strategies (Fig. \ref{fig:PrimingMinDec}). With
adaptive microbial enzyme allocation (Revenue strategy), increasing
plant litter input or increases in litter C/N upregulated
the decomposition of the N-rich residue pool (Fig.
\ref{fig:CO2Increase}).
This in turn influenced the distribution of N in the ecosystem, and N
availability for plants (Fig.
\ref{fig:CO2IncreaseImb}). This active role of plant inputs has been
demonstrated in a soil incubation experiment \citep{Fontaine11} and has been
further conceptualised with the SYMPHONY model \citep{Perveen14}. Our results
are in line with these studies, although our explanation is on a more abstract
level (see Section \ref{sec:Holistic}). 

Mineralization during microbial turnover is important for nutrient recycling.
Without the additional mineralization mechanisms of uptake mineralization
\citep{Manzoni08} and turnover mineralization \citep{Clarholm85, Raynaud06}
($\epsilon_{\operatorname{tvr}}=1$) in the \chem{CO_2}-Fertilization simulation
experiment, microbes shifted enzyme allocation to degrade the residues pool, but
the N was then sequestered in microbial biomass and not mineralised to inorganic
N. Hence, our simulation experiments reinforced the need for representing soil
heterogeneity and microbial turnover by grazing for making N available for
plants under N limitation.

\subsection{Mismatch in time scale of priming effects}
The unrealistically long time-scale of the priming effect of several months in
SEAM (Fig. \ref{fig:PrimingMinDec}) resulted from both, the long turnover time of
enzymes, and the sustaining positive feedback between amounts of microbial
biomass and enzymes. It was in contrast with incubation studies that observe
priming effects within days or weeks that rapidly declined after the amendment
has been used up \citep{Blagodatskaya14}.
The priming timescale in SEAM was longer than the duration of the uptake pulse
of the $L$ amendment that only lasted a few days. It was controlled by simulated
lifetime of enzymes and enzyme turnover, which SEAM described as first order
kinetics with a turnover of about a week. Moreover, the priming timescale was
prolonged by the positive feedback of increased microbial biomass producing more
enzymes that again fuelled microbial biomass. 

One possible hypothesis for a shorter priming time-scale is a different dynamics
of enzyme turnover. However, prescribing a shorter turnover time of enzymes would
require an unrealistically large effort of producing enzymes by microbial
biomass. More sophisticated models of different enzyme turnover kinetics
including stabilisation of a part of the enzymes on mineral surfaces
\citep{Burns13} may be able to resolve such contradictions. Testing this
hypothesis would require observations of the fraction of C uptake allocated to
enzyme synthesis and on age distribution of enzymes in the soil which might be
feasable with labelling studies.

An alternative cause for a shorter priming time-scale may be an important
control of enzyme activity that is not as strongly coupled to microbial biomass
dynamics. Some enzymes such as peroxidase need to be fuelled by labile OM
themselves \citep{Rousk14} with no immediate relationship to microbial biomass
dynamics. This explanation, however, implies that enzyme activity and
decomposition of SOM become largely decoupled from enzyme synthesis and
microbial dynamics in the short-term. This option is contrary to the assumption
of most current models that simulate the priming effect. Such a fundamental
change of model assumption would affect most implications gained from
SOM modelling studies that involve soil microbes.

Another cause for a shorter priming time-scale, is a diminished sustaining
positive feedback between enzymes and microbial biomass. Currently, grazing is
modelled as an implicit part of a first-order microbial turnover. With
increasing microbial biomass, grazers become more efficient \citep{Clarholm81}.
With implementing a time-lagged stronger increase in microbial turnover rate
with microbial biomass, biomass levels would decrease faster to pre-treatment
levels and help to shorten the time-scale of the priming effect. Testing this
hypothesis requires data on grazing during priming effects.

Overall, the mismatch in the time scale of priming between simulations and
observations hints to gaps in understanding of short-term SOM turnover. 
However, this model limitation does not impair the
simulated longer-term microbial community controls on SOM cycling both in the
prototypic simulation and at the pasture site. We argue therefore that the
simulated decadal patterns are robust, because they are more strongly
controlled by the proportions in enzyme synthesis than by the time scale of
priming effects. 

\subsection{A holistic view for upscaling}
\label{sec:Holistic}

The presented SEAM model takes a holistic view \citep{Panikov10} of microbial
community and their adaptations instead of explicitly describing microbial
diversity.
In this respect, it differs from the SYMPHONY model \citep{Perveen14} and
similar models \citep{Fontaine03}, which explicitly model several microbial
groups.
% specifically SOM builders, that grow solely on fresh low nutrient material
% (here $L$), and SOM builders that can use all the SOM.
However, the effective behaviour of the presented SEAM model is similar to these
models.
SEAM assumes that community composition adapts to external drivers.
Specifically, SEAM describes an adaptive allocation of resources into
depolymerisation of different substrates by assuming that the community
composition reacts to changed substrate availability in a way to balance
microbe's revenue of the currently limiting element.
While the mechanistic approach of the SYMPHONY model explicitly represents this
adaptation by shifts between microbial groups, the holistic approach represents
its effects at community level. While the mechanistic approach provides more
detailed understanding, the proposed abstraction of microbial competition is a
step forward to better represent couplings of soil carbon and nutrient cycles in
large-scale ecosystem models, as it obviates the need to correctly parameterise
the underlying details of several microbial guilds.
% \citep{Wutzler13}.

The holistic SEAM model yielded qualitatively similar predictions as the
mechanistic SYMPHONY model with simulating priming effects, the bank mechanism,
and a continuous SOM sequestration under high inorganic N inputs. SEAM differed
from SYMPHONY in the prediction of the inorganic N pool during low N inputs.
Specifically, SEAM predicted a decrease in this pool, while SYMPHONY predicted
an increase in this pool due to changed competition \citep{Perveen14}. The
difference is probably caused by different assumptions on how the DOM pool is
shared among groups of the microbial community and resulting different
competition conditions. In SEAM, decomposition products become mixed in a shared
DOM pool, while in the SYMPHONY model the decomposition products are not shared
between the microbial groups.
The truth at pore scale is in between, in that decomposition products are mainly
used by the group that is producing the extracellular enzymes, while a part of
the DOM diffuses also to other groups \citep{Kaiser14}. At larger scales, such
details cannot be measured or resolved. The difference in model prediction
implies that the rationality of the simplified model assumptions of a mixed DOM
pool can be qualitatively tested against observations.

\subsection{Testable predictions of change of SOM C/N ratios}
The SEAM model can be used to predict decadal patterns of SOM cycling following
changes in substrate stoichiometry. Observations of such patterns provide evidence
for or against the modelling assumptions.
Specifically, SEAM predicted a change in proportions of the litter pool and the
SOM pool (Fig. \ref{fig:CO2Increase}). While these abstract pools are not
directly comparable to observations, a measurable consequence is the associated
change of total SOM C/N ratio at the time scale of turnover of the residue
pool. Specifically, SEAM predicted a decline in SOM stocks and an increase of
SOM C/N with FACE experiments at formerly C-limited systems over time scales of
several decades. Observed accelerated SOM turnover at the Duke forst after 12
years of elevated \chem{CO_2} \citep{Drake11} is a first indications, although
there ist a continuum of responses to experimental \chem{CO_2} increase across sites.
 
\subsection{Outlook} 
The biggest limitation of the SEAM model is its focus on a single process:
community adaptation of enzyme allocation. In order to focus, we had to ignore
several other important processes. One such process is the second microbial
community strategy of handling substrate stoichiometric imbalance, the adaption
of stoichiometry of microbial biomass. Although the potential of this biomass
adaptation is thought to be quite limited \citep{Mooshammer14}, it will need to
be tested whether these two strategies can be combined within a model.

Next, the optimality principle will be extended to also determine the proportion
of uptake that is allocated to enzyme synthesis. Presence of cheaters, i.e.
microbes that consume substrate but without producing enzymes, effectively lower
the community-level allocation to enzymes \citep{Kaiser14}. We could assume
that community development maximizes biomass production. Such
an assumption can be used to compute the optimal community enzyme synthesis and allows
exploring effects on SOM cycling, such as more constrained carbon and nutrient
use efficiencies.

Moreover, SEAM will be simplified by assuming quasi-steady state of biomass or
enzyme pools \citep{Wutzler13}. These simplifications will lead to fewer
parameters and improved parameter identifiably in model calibration to
observations \citep{Xu14}.
Together with implementing the influence of environmental factors such as
temperature and moisture \citep{Davidson12}, these changes will make SEAM more
suitable to be used as a component within larger scale land surface models.
 
\conclusions
% % \conclusions[modified heading if necessary]
The SEAM model (Fig. \ref{fig:SEAMStruct}) provides a holistic description of
community adaptations. It yields qualitatively similar predictions as
microbial-group-explicit models with the ability to represent priming effects,
bank mechanism, and a continuous SOM sequestration with high inorganic N inputs
(Fig. \ref{fig:pastureFitScen}). Hence, this study is an important step
for providing an abstract description of microbial community effects and
adaptations, with the long-term goal of including the important mechanisms into
earth system models.

Adapting the allocation of resources into the synthesis of different enzymes can
be an effective means of the microbial community to react to changing substrate
stoichiometry. Allocation adaptation strategies helped the simulated microbial
biomass in SEAM to grow larger across a wider range of substrate stoichiometry
(Fig. \ref{fig:VarNNoFeedback}). Among the tested strategies, the Revenue
strategy, which accounts for the amount of substrate pools and their
stoichiometry, was particularly successful.
These findings imply that models simulating soil carbon and nutrients dynamics
(Fig. \ref{fig:PrimingMinDec}) need to account for adaptations in carbon and
nutrient strategies. Accounting for adaptations will be especially important
when studying the competition for nutrients between soil microorganisms and
plants, because SOM can function as a storage to sequester surplus nutrients and
prevent them from being lost from the system (Fig.
\ref{fig:CO2Increase} and \ref{fig:CO2IncreaseImb}).
