The global element cycles of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are intrically linked
and cannot be understood without their interactions 
\citep{Thornton07,Janssens10, Zaehle11}. 
The links between nutrient cycles are especially strong
in the dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM) because all of the SOM has to be
depolymerized and successively mineralized by a microbial community with a
rather strict homeostatic regulation \citep{Sterner02, Zechmeister15}.

Faced with imbalances between stoichiometry of OM, i.e. the litter and SOM they
feed on, and stoichiometric requirements of decomposers, decomposers have three
options \citep{Mooshammer14}.
First, they can adapt their carbon use efficiency (CUE) or nutrient use
efficiency (NUE) \citep{Sinsabaugh13}. The alteration of CUE has shown to have
large consequences on prediction of carbon sequestration in SOM
\citep{Allison14a, Wieder13}.
Regulation of NUE has consequences for nutrient recycling and loss of nutrients
from the ecosystem \citep{Mooshammer14a} and soil plant feedback
\citep{Rastetter11}.
As a second option, decomposer communities can adapt their stoichiometric
requirements. Community composition can shift between species with high C/N
ratio, such as many fungi, or species with lower C/N ratio, such as many
bacteria \citep{Cleveland07, Xu13}, although the flexibility is very narrow.
As a third option, decomposers can adapt their allocation of resources into
production of different extracellular enzymes to preferentially degrade
fractions of SOM that differ by their stoichiometry \citep{Moorhead12}.

Representation and consequences of stoichiometry on element cycling differ
between models at different scales. Most soil models at ecosystem scale
employ the first option and use CUE or NUE to represent stoichiometric controls
on respiration and mineralization fluxes \citep{Manzoni08}. However, modelling
studies at the pore scale, which is relevant to microbes, show the
important effect of community adaptation and their emerging effects on element cycling
\citep{Allison05, Resat11, Wang13}. Competition among several
microbial groups that differed in expression of different enzymes resulted in a
simulated approximately equally high CUE across a wider range of litter
stoichiometry \citep{Kaiser14}. Hence, there is a need to capture the effects of community
adaptation also in models at ecosystem scale. 

Effects of microbial diversity can be represented at ecosystem scale by at least
two options. First, competition of several microbial populations can be
explicitely modeled to represent stoichiometric effects such as sustained
sequestration of N with high N inputs \citep{Perveen14}.
Second, adaptation of effective properties of the entire microbial community,
such as uptake efforts \citep{Rastetter97, Rastetter11}, can represent the
emerging effects in an abstract but dynamic and adaptive way.

The adaptation of enzyme production was recently
formalized by the conceptual EEZY model \citep{Moorhead12}. While this model
showed the principle feasibility of this strategy in short term, it did not
implement feedback to SOM pools and therefore could not study
consequences for longer term SOM cycling. 

Out task, therefore, was to tackle the need of capturing the effects of adaptive
enzyme production on long term SOM dynamics and nutrient recycling. We extended
the EEZY model to explore different consequences of alternative enzyme
allocation schemes.

This paper first introduces the SEAM model (Section \ref{sec:SEAM}), a
dynamical model of SOM cycling that explicitly represents microbial strategies
(Section \ref{sec:AllocStrategies}) of producing several extracellular enzyme
pools. Next, the effects of those strategies on SOM cycling are presented by
prototypical examples (Sections \ref{sec:SimScen} and \ref{sec:ResultsProto}).
Finally, a calibration to an intensive pasture site (Section
\ref{sec:methodsPasture}) demonstrates the usability of the model (Section
\ref{sec:ResultsPasture}) and compares its predictions to the ones of
the Symphony model \citep{Perveen14}, which explicitely models several
microbial-group.

This study shows that different decomposer enzyme allocation strategies
have large consequences on long term SOM dynamics and nutrient recycling. It
proposes a holistic scheme to represent effects of microbial adaptation of
enzyme production on SOM cycle at the ecosystem scale.


\section{Methods}
\subsection{Soil Enzyme Allocation Model (SEAM)}
\label{sec:SEAM}

Development of the dynamic Soil Enzyme Allocation Model
(SEAM) allowed to explore consequences of enzyme allocation strategies for SOM
cycling at the soil core scale. The modelled system are C and N
pools in SOM in a representative elemental volume of soil. The
system could be soil of a laboratory incubation or a layer of a soil profile,
e.g. its upper 20cm.
The model represents different pools of C and N as state variables
and specifies dynamic equations for the mass fluxes. It is driven by inputs of
plant litter (both above ground and rhizodeposition) and inorganic N
inputs, as well as prescribed uptake of inorganic N by roots.  It
computes output fluxes of heterotrophic respiration and leaching of inorganic
N.

Key features are first, the representation of several SOM pools that differ by
their stoichiometry, i.e. elemental ratios, and second, the representation of
specific enzymes that degrade those SOM pools. The quality spectrum is modelled by two
classes: a C rich litter pool,
$\operatorname{L}$, and a N rich pool that consists
mainly of microbial residues, $\operatorname{R}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:SEAMStruct}).

\begin{figure}[t] \vspace*{2mm}
\begin{center}

\end{center}
\caption{
Model structure of SEAM: Two resource pools ($L$ and $R$) which differ in their
elemental ratios are depolymerized by respective enzymes ($E_L$ and $E_R$). The
simple organic compounds ($\operatorname{DOM}$) are taken up by the microbial
community  and used for synthesizing new biomass (${B}$), new enzymes, for
catabolic respiration. Stoichiometric imbalance between $\operatorname{DOM}$ and ${B}$
causes overflow respiration or mineralization/immobilization ($\Phi_B$) of
inorganic N ($I$), which is detailed Fig. \ref{fig:SEAMStructNFluxes}. Boxes

represent fluxes of both C and N, while dotted and dashed lines represent
separate C or N fluxes respectively.

}
\end{figure}

The most important assumptions are described in the following paragraphs, while
the symbols are explained in Tab. \ref{tab:modelParameters} and detailed model
equations are given in Appendix \ref{app:SEAM}. 

\include{SEAM_symbols} 

Decomposition of litter and residue pool follows an inverse Michaelis-Menten
kinetics \citep{Schimel03}, which is first order to the amount of OM, and
saturating with the amount of the respective enzyme. C/N ratios, $\beta$, of the
decomposition flux is equal to the C/N ratios of the decomposed pool. C/N ratios
of biomass and enzymes are fixed while those of the resource pools may change
over time due to changing C/N ratio of total influx to these pools. Imbalances
in stoichiometry of uptake and microbial requirements are compensated by
overflow respiration or N mineralization.
Total enzyme allocation is a fixed fraction, $a_E$, of the microbial biomass,
$B$, per time. But microbial community can use different strategies (Section
\ref{sec:AllocStrategies}) to adjust their allocation to production of
alternative kinds of new enzymes.
The DOM pool is assumed to be in quasi steady state and the sum of all influxes
to the DOM pool, i.e. decomposition plus part of the enzyme turnover, is taken
up by the microbial community. If expenses for maintenance and enzyme production
cannot be met, the microbial biomass starves and declines.

\subsection{Exchange with inorganic N pools}

The imbalance flux, $\Phi_B$, lets microbes mineralize
access N or immobilize required N up to a maximum rate of
$u_{\operatorname{imm,Pot}}$, which increases linearly with the inorganic N
pool.
While this stoichiometric imbalance flux is the most widely implemented flux
between microbial biomass and the inorganic carbon pool in SOM
models \citep{Manzoni09}, it is not sufficient to recycle N to the inorganic
pool if microbial biomass is itself uptake N limited.
Therefore, two additional mineralization fluxes are implemented with the SEAM
model (Fig. \ref{fig:SEAMStructNFluxes}). First, a fraction of microbial DON
uptake, termed uptake mineralization $\Phi_u$, is apparently mineralized that
accounts for C-limited locations in heterogeneous soil \citep{Manzoni08}.
Second, a fraction of microbial turnover is mineralized that accounts for
grazing. Grazers respire part of the grazed biomass C for their energy, and must
release an equivalent amount of nutrients to match their stoichiometric demands.
This mineralization component, here termed turnover mineralization
$\Phi_{\operatorname{tvr}}$, has been formalized in the soil microbial loop
hypothesis \citep{Clarholm85, Raynaud06}.

\begin{figure}[t] \vspace*{2mm}
\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{fig/seam_NFluxes} 
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{fig/seam_NFluxes} 
\end{center}
\caption{
In addition to the maybe negative imbalance flux, $\Phi_B$ of microbial biomass,
$B$, there are additional mineralization fluxes feeding the inorganic pool, $I$,
due to mineralization during uptake, $\Phi_u$, and mineralization during
microbial turnover, $\Phi_{\operatorname{tvr}}$. The N dynamics depends also on
fluxes across the system boundary, namely input of organic N with litter, input
of inorganic N $iI$, leaching, and plant uptake of inorganic N.
\label{fig:SEAMStructNFluxes}}
\end{figure}

A refinement of the term N limitation (Table \ref{tab:NutrientLimDefs}) is
required by the introduction of the additional N mineralization fluxes.
When microbes can meet their stoichiometric demand only by immobilizing
 N, we suggest the term uptake N limitation.
When the immobilization flux cannot meet microbe's stoichiometric requirements,
we suggest the term microbial N limitation. Despite the maximum immobilization
flux there might still be a net mineralization due to uptake mineralization and
turnover mineralization.
When there is a net immobilization, i.e. a net transfer from inorganic pool to
the organic pools of SOM and microbial biomass, we suggest the term \remarkTW{SOM
N limitation}{still searching for a better term here}.

\subsection{ Enzyme allocation strategies} 
\label{sec:AllocStrategies}

Three different strategies of allocating investments among production of
alternative enzymes were explored in this study (Table
\ref{tab:AllocStrategies}). Microbes allocate a proportion $\alpha$ of total
enzyme investments, $a_e\,B$, to the production of enzymes targeting the N rich
$R$ resource and proportion $1 - \alpha$ to the production of enzymes targeting
the N poor but better degradable $L$ resource: $\operatorname{alloc}_{E_R} /
(\operatorname{alloc}_{E_R} + \operatorname{alloc}_{E_L}) = \alpha$.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Microbial enzyme allocation strategies \label{tab:AllocStrategies}}
\vskip4mm
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\tophline
Strategy &  Allocation is \\
\middlehline
Fixed & independent, constant \\
Match & adjusted to achieve balanced growth ($\beta_{DOM} = \beta_{B}$)  \\
Revenue & proportional to return per investments into enzymes \\
\bottomhline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


The \textbf{Fixed} strategy assumes that allocation is independent
and not changing with changes in substrate availability.
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:allocFixed}
\alpha = \operatorname{const.} = 1/2
\end{equation}
This strategy corresponds to the models where decomposition rate is a function
of microbial biomass \citep{Wutzler08}.
 
The \textbf{Match} strategy assumes that microbes regulate enzymes production in
a way that decomposition products balance their stoichiometric demands
\citep{Moorhead12}.
The partitioning coefficient is derived by equating the C/N ratio of the sum of
uptake fluxes after other expenses to the C/N ratio of microbial biomass,
$\beta_B$.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:allocMatchCN}
\frac{\epsilon (\operatorname{dec}_L + \operatorname{dec}_R - r_M)}{
\operatorname{dec}_L/\beta_L + \operatorname{dec}_R/\beta_R  - \Phi_M } =
\beta_B
\text{,}
\end{equation}
where $\operatorname{dec}_L$, and $\operatorname{dec}_R$ are depolymerization
fluxes of the litter and residue resources respectively, $r_M$ is maintenance
respiration, $\epsilon$ is the anabolic microbial efficiency (\ref{eq:synB}),
and $\beta_i$ are C/N ratios of the respective pools $i$, and $\Phi_M$ is the
net flux of N from living microbes to the mineral N pool. Equation
\ref{eq:allocMatchCN} for simplicity neglects the small inputs of enyzmes to DOM. Here, we assume that
microbes use the maximal immobilization of inorganic N, $u_{\operatorname{imm,Pot}}$ (\ref{eq:uN}), to meet their stoichiometric
requirements with the Match strategy. Hence, the net N flux is the difference
between mineralization during uptake and the immobilization: $\Phi_M = \Phi_u -
u_{\operatorname{imm,Pot}}$. With microbial N limitation,
(\ref{eq:allocMatchCN})  has no solution, enzymes are allocated entirely to
the N-rich resource ($\alpha=1$), and excess carbon is
respired by overflow respiration.

When the current sum of enzyme levels, $E$ is assumed to be in quasi
steady state for given amounts of resource and microbial biomass, then equation
\ref{eq:allocMatchCN} can be solved for allocation partitioning, $\alpha$,
because the decompostion fluxes $\operatorname{dec}_L$ and
$\operatorname{dec}_R$ are functions of $\alpha$ (Appendix
\ref{app:fAlphaFix}).
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:allocMatch} 
\begin{align}
\alpha_M &= f_{\operatorname{{\alpha}Fix}}(L,\beta_L,R,\beta_R, E_L, E_R, r_M,
\Phi_M)
\\
\alpha &= \begin{cases}
  0,  & \text{if} \alpha_M \le 0 \\
  1,  & \text{if} \alpha_M \ge 1 \\
  \alpha_M, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}   
\end{align}
\end{subequations} 

\noindent
The bound to one is necessary to handle the case of microbial N
limitation, and the bound to zero corresponds to the theoretical case where the
C rich resource may not suffice to cover microbial C demands. 
Function $f_{\operatorname{{\alpha}Fix}}$ is given in appendix
\ref{app:fAlphaFix} and the SYMPY script of its 
derivation is given with supplementary material. 

The \textbf{Revenue} strategy assumes that microbial community adapts in a way
so that investment into enzyme production is proportional to their revenue, i.e.
their return per investment regarding the currently limiting element:
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:allocRev}
\begin{align}
\alpha_C &= \frac{\operatorname{rev}_{RC}}{\operatorname{rev}_{LC} + \operatorname{rev}_{RC}} 
\\
\alpha_N &= \frac{\operatorname{rev}_{RN}}{\operatorname{rev}_{LN} + \operatorname{rev}_{RN}} 
\text{,} 
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\operatorname{rev}_S$ is the revenue from given resource $S$ ($S$ is
either $L$ or $R$) under C and N limitation respectively. The return is the
current decomposition flux from the resource degraded by the respective enzyme,
and the investment is assumed to be equal to enzyme turnover to keep current
enzyme levels, $E_S^*$.
% : $a_E B = k_{NR} E_R^* + k_{NL} E_L^*$.
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:allocRev2}
\begin{align}
\operatorname{rev}_{SC} &= \frac{\text{return}}{\text{investment}} 
= \frac{\operatorname{dec}_{S,Pot} \frac{E_S^*}{K_{M,S} + E_S^*}} {k_{NS}E_S^*} 
= \frac{\operatorname{dec}_{S,Pot}} {k_{NS}(K_{M,S} + E_S^*)} 
\\ 
\operatorname{rev}_{SN} &= \frac{\operatorname{dec}_{S,Pot}
\frac{E_S^*}{K_{M,S} + E_S^*} / \beta_S} {k_{NS} E_S^* / \beta_E} 
= \operatorname{rev}_{SC} \frac{\beta_E}{\beta_S}
% \\
% = \frac{\operatorname{dec}_{S,Pot}}{k_{NS} (K_{M,S} + E_S^*)} 
% \frac{\beta_E}{\beta_S}
\text{,} 
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $k_{NS}$ is rate of enzyme turnover, $K_{M,S}$ is enzyme's resource
affinity, $\operatorname{dec}_{S,Pot}$ is
enzyme saturated decomposition flux (\ref{eq:dec}), and $\beta$ are C/N ratios
of the respective pools.

There are two resulting partitioning coefficients, $\alpha_C$ and $\alpha_N$
with C or N limited microbial biomass repectively. In order to avoid frequent large jumps
under near co-limitation, SEAM implements a smooth transition between these two
cases as a weighted average.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:allocRev3}
%\begin{align}
\alpha = \frac{w_{\operatorname{CLim}} \alpha_C + w_{\operatorname{NLim}}
\alpha_N}{w_{\operatorname{CLim}}  + w_{\operatorname{NLim}} } 
\text{,} 
%\end{align}
\end{equation}
where $w$ is the strength of the limitation of the respective element,
specifically the ratio of required to available biomass synthesis fluxes
(\ref{eq:weightsLim}).


\subsection{ Prototypical simulation scenarios} 
\label{sec:SimScen}

Several prototypical simulation scenarios (Table \ref{tab:SimScen}) were used to
explore consequences of different microbial enzyme allocation strategies for SOM
dynamics. All scenarios used parameter values given in Table
\ref{tab:modelParameters}, if not stated specifically otherwise. Inorganic N
pool was kept steady at $I=0.4 \mathrm{gN}$, here, while inorganic N feedback
is studied in section \ref{sec:methodsPasture}.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Prototypical simulation scenarios \label{tab:SimScen}}
\vskip4mm
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lp{5.3cm}}
\tophline
Scenario & Explored issue\\
\middlehline
VarN-Incubation & Efficieny of using given fixed resource levels that
vary by N content \\
Feedback-Steady & Possibility and size of steady state resource pools\\
Priming & Increased resource decomposition and mineralization after
a pulse addition of fresh litter\\
\chem{CO_2}-Fertilization & Continuous increase of litter C inputs but constant litter N
inputs
\\
\bottomhline
\end{tabular} 
\end{table}

The \textbf{VarN-Incubation} scenario explored how resources of given
stoichiometry are used more or less efficiently for microbial biomass growth
with different enzyme allocation scenarios. It used a simplified model where all
the inputs and feedback to the resource pools ($L$ and $R$) and to the inorganic
N pool ($I$) were neglected and these pools were kept constant ($dL/dt = dR/dt =
0$). It allowed microbes and enzyme levels to develop to a quasi steady state
with the given resource supply. Hence, it simulated the end of a short term
incubation where changes of litter and residue pools are negligible small.
Specifically, it used fixed resource carbon of $L=100 \unit{gCm^2}$, $R=400 \unit{gCm^2}$.
It set C/N ratio of the residue pool to $\beta_R=7$, and varied the litter C/N
ratio ($\beta_L = [18,..,42]$).

The \textbf{Feedback-Steady} scenario explored the long term trajectories of the
entire system including feedback to the substrate pools starting from a system
state away from steady-state. Specifically, it set litter input to
$\operatorname{input}_L = 400~\unit{gCm^2yr^{-1}}$ with C/N ratio
$\beta_{\operatorname{input}_L} = 30$.

The \textbf{Priming} scenario explored the effect of rhizosphere priming, i.e
the input of fresh litter into a bulk subsoil. It looked at the fluxes after an
addition of $50gC$ carbon and a respective amount of N on a soil that otherwise
received a litter input of only 30 \unit{gCm^2yr^{-1}} (and
respective N) for a decade. It simulated a very easily degradable litter and
amendmend, specifically with a maximum turnover of $k_L = 10~\unit{day^{-1}}$.

The \textbf{\chem{CO_2}-Fertilization} scenario explored the effect of
continuous increased carbon litter input that is expected with elevated atmospheric \chem{CO_2}.
It started from steady state for a litter input, applied 20\% increased
carbon inputs during years 10 to 60, and applied original carbon inputs again
during the next 50 years. The N inputs were kept constant over time.

\subsection{Calibration to a fertilized grassland site}
\label{sec:methodsPasture}

To test the capability of the SEAM model to simulate the carbon sink of a
grassland site, we calibrated the model using the revenue strategy to data of an
intensive pasture.
The model drivers and most of the parametrization was taken from the publication
of \citep{Perveen14}. The site is a temperate permanent grassland located at an
altitude of 1040m in France (Laqueuille, 45\textdegree{38}'N,
2\textdegree{44}'E) and has an annual precipitation and temperature of 1200~mm
and 7 \textdegree{C}, respectively.

The N balance of the fertilized grassland is characterized by high inorganic
N-inputs. Part of this N is sequestered in accumulating SOM, part is leached and
part is exported with plant biomass. In all scenarios, plant uptake of inorganic N was
computed assuming the plants to be in steady state with the litter
production and biomass exports.
 
Parameters were chosen corresponding to Table 1 in \citep{Perveen14}. Three
parameters were calibrated: the maximum decomposition rates of substrate pools,
$k_L$ and $k_R$, and the anabolic carbon use efficiency, $\epsilon$. Initial
pools were prescribed to observed values. Intial pools of microbial biomass and
enzymes were set to the long-term state after a preliminary optimization in
order to prevent large initial fluctuations. The calibrations used the
\textit{optim} function from R \textit{stats} package \citep{R07} to minimize
the differences between model predictions and observations normalized by the
standard deviation of the observations. It used observations of the litter
OM, the inorganic N, leaching, and rate of change of the total SOM pool
($\approx dR/dt$ if $L$ is near quasis steady state). Next, the calibrated
parameters were used generate predictions for scenarios of changed inputs to
the system.

 
\section{Results}

First, the results of several prototypical artificial simulation scenarios
clarify the general behaviour and features of the SEAM model. Next, results of a
parameter calibration demonstrate the model's ability to
simulate the observed C and N dynamics of an intensive pasture and explore
feedbacks with the dynamics of the inorganic N pool.

\subsection{Prototypical simulation scenarios}
\label{sec:ResultsProto}

With the \textbf{VarN-Incubation} scenario, where the resource pools were fixed,
there were differences among allocation strategies for the dependence of
allocation $\alpha$ on the N content of the litter resource. The different
strategies caused marked changes in biomass and imbalance fluxes (Fig.
\ref{fig:VarNNoFeedback}).
 
\begin{figure}[t] \vspace*{2mm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{fig/VarNNoFeedback}
\end{center}
\caption{
Match enzyme allocations strategy yielded highest resource efficiency, i.e.
lowest mineralization fluxes at steady state with the VarN-scenario. Microbes
with alternative strategies, however, competed better indicated by a higher
biomass. Carbon use efficiency (CUE) and C/N ratio of the decomposition flux
(cnDOM) helped to explain the different patterns.
\label{fig:VarNNoFeedback}}
\end{figure}

The Match strategy allowed balanced growth and efficient resource usage, but
yielded less biomass than the other scenarios. When the litter contained enough
N, microbes invested all resources into litter degrading enzymes.
Across a wide range of litter C/N ratios (22 to 42) microbes did not need
stoichiometric imbalance fluxes, i.e. mineralization of excess N
or overflow respiration of excess C.  

With the Revenue strategy enzyme allocation varied with litter N content, too.
With litter containing enough N (low C/N ratio), still about 5\% of the enzyme C
expenditures were allocated into R degrading enzymes. This resulted in higher
mineralization of excess N, but in turn allowed for a higher microbial biomass.
With litter lacking enough N (higher C/N ratios), investment into R-degrading enzymes
increased to about 30\%, a value that was much lower than with the the Match
strategy. Hence, the Revenue strategy yielded higher overflow respiration
associated with low carbon use efficiency (CUE). However, at the same time, it
yielded higher levels of microbial biomass.

The Fixed strategy yielded higher N-mineralization due to stoichiometric
imbalance at low C/N ratios.
At high C/N ratios its allocation was intermediate between the other strategies leading
to intermediate values of all the other outputs.

% Threshold elemental ratio slightly increased with higher litter C/N ratio, as
% can be seen in the C/N ratio of the DOM in the match strategy (Fig.
% \ref{fig:VarNNoFeedback}). The reason for this increase, here, was a lower
% proportion of uptake flux compared to immobilization flux with lower biomass.

With the \textbf{Feedback-Steady} scenario, where resource pools where refueled
by microbial and enzyme turnover, both Fixed and the Revenue strategies caused
resource pools to approach a steady state.
However, the microbes with Match strategy solely degraded the stoichiometrically
better matching high-N residue pool, $R$. Hence, they declined together with the
R residues pool despite the large amount of N accumulating in the
stoichiometrically less favourable litter pool (Fig. \ref{fig:SimSteady}).

\begin{figure}[t]
\vspace*{2mm}
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{fig/SimSteady} 
\end{center}
\caption{Match strategy was not viable when considering feedback to
substrate pools with the SimSteady scenario, where microbes degraded a
stoichiometrically matching but depleted R substrate pool.
\label{fig:SimSteady}} 
\end{figure}

Because of the Match strategy was not able to simulate reasonable
stocks when including feedback to resource pools in the model, it was omitted
in the following simulation scenarios.

With the \textbf{Priming} scenario, where a soil was amended with a pulse of
litter, a clear real priming effect was simulated.
The priming effect is by a strongly enhanced decomposition of the residues
pool (Fig. \ref{fig:PrimingDec}). It was stronger with the Revenue strategy than
with the Fixed strategy. This stronger priming was mostly due to a higher microbial
biomass with the Revenue strategy. Therefore also the N-mineralization flux due
to microbial turnover was larger with the Revenue strategy (Fig.
\ref{fig:PrimingMin}).

\begin{figure}[t]
\vspace*{2mm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{fig/PrimingDec}

\caption{Residue depolymerization flux increased strongest with the Revenue
strategy after amending a starved subsoil with a pulse of fresh litter with the

\end{center}
\caption{Priming a low-input soil by a fresh litter pulse stimulated N
mineralization most strongly with the Revenue strategy with the Priming scenario.
\label{fig:PrimingMin}}
\end{figure}

With the \textbf{\chem{CO_2}-Fertilization} scenario, where litter C input was
increased, enzyme allocation strategies yielded most marked differences between
strategies in both SOM stocks (Fig. \ref{fig:CO2Increase}) and nutrient
recycling (Fig. \ref{fig:CO2IncreaseImb}).
While litter stocks $L$ increased with both scenarios, the residues stock $R$
slightly increased with the Fixed strategy but declined with the Revenue
strategy. In addition N mineralization was much stronger with the Revenue
scenario during elevated \chem{CO_2} period, with largest contribution from
mineralization by microbial turnover.

\subsection{Intensive pasture simulation}
\label{sec:ResultsPasture}

The SEAM model successfully simulated the C and N balance of the Laqueuille
intensive pasture (Figure \ref{fig:pastureFit} left). The observed continuous
buildup of a pool of organic N in the residue SOM was driven by the systems
positive N balance. It was simulated with SEAM by two pathways. First, inorganic
N was taken up by the plant and supplied via organic N in litter, and second,
microbial biomass immobilized inorganic N due to stoichiometric imbalance of
substrate. The microbial biomass was N-limited when looking at the organic
substrate only. However, it was C-limited when taking into account
immobilization of inorganic N.

\begin{figure}[t] \vspace*{2mm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{fig/pastureFit} 
\end{center}
\caption{
Calibrated Seam model predictions matched observed values of the Laqueuille
intensive pasture (dots and errorbars left). Prescribed alteration of C and N
inputs led to subsequent shifts in enzyme allocation ($\alpha$) and affected
development of soil pools (right) compared to the scenario of observed inputs
(control same as in left panel).
Increased N substrate limitation, either due to elevated \chem{CO_2} or due to
decreasing inorganic N inputs, caused an increase in litter pool, $L$, and a
decrease in mineral N pool, $I$. If the substrate N limitation could not be
balanced by inorganic N input, then the change rate of the residue pool, $dR$,
decreased down to negative values, i.e. losses.

\end{figure}   

Alteration of C and N inputs to the system strongly affected the internal SOM
and nutrient cycling. This effects was shown by several simulation scenarios
that started from the calibrated state but applied a step change in inputs of
litter or inorganic N (Figure \ref{fig:pastureFit} right) as detailed in
following paragraphs.

\textit{Increased litter C input} by 50\% together with an increased litter C/N
ratio by 25\% with the elevated \chem{CO_2} scenario caused a shift in enzyme
allocation towards enzymes degrading the N-rich residue pool and an increase of
the litter pool. It also increased the demand for mineral N, both for the plant
to balance increased biomass production and for microbial biomass with higher
stoichiometric imbalance. The resulting decrease in mineral N also decreased
leaching losses.
In addition available N was reused more often, because of a higher
turnover flux of N in increased microbial biomass.

\textit{Decreased inorganic N inputs} from 22.9
\unit{gm^{-2}yr^{-1}} down to 1
\unit{gm^{-2}yr^{-1}} together with a doubling of litter C/N
ratio caused a strong shift in enzyme allocation towards enzymes degrading the
N-rich residue SOM with similar consequences as with increased C input,
such as an increase in litter OM. However, here, the decreased N inputs caused
a depletion of the mineral N pool.
As a consequence, the microbial biomass could not use immobilization to
balance substrate stoichiometry and became N-limited.
This caused overflow respiration and a decreasing trend in residue SOM.

\textit{Increased inorganic N inputs} from 22.9 \unit{gm^{-2}yr^{-1}} up to 25.6
\unit{gm^{-2}yr^{-1}} together with a decrase of litter C/N by 25\% did not
much affect the system behaviour because the soil system was already C-limited
before.
The microbes could only immobilize a small part of the additional N for building
up SOM. Instead, N accumulated in the inorganic pool with associated
increased losses by leaching.


\section{Discussion}
Microbial adaptation of enzyme production benefited the community so that higher
biomass levels could be sustained on a wider range of substrate stoichiometry.
The different prototypic simulation scenarios and the simulation of the
intensive pasture led to similar conclusions on comparing the different enzyme
allocation adaptation strategies.

\subsection{Amounts of resources matter}
Both, the amounts of resource pools and resource stoichiometry are important for
regulating enzyme allocation. The match strategy failed to account for resource
amounts, assuming that microbes can achieve balanced growth under a wide
range of resource stoichiometry \citep{Moorhead12, Ballantyne14}. The strategy
was not competetive, as incidated by declining microbial biomass stocks both in
the VarN-Incubation scenario (Fig. \ref{fig:VarNNoFeedback}) and in the
SimSteady scenarios (Fig. \ref{fig:SimSteady}). Microbes focused on degrading a
stoichiometrically balanced but declining residues pool despite the huge amount
of N available in a large but stoichiometrically less favourable litter pool
(Fig. \ref{fig:SimSteady}). This finding implies that microbial enzyme
allocation strategies must account for resource amounts.

\subsection{Community adaptation leads to more efficient resource usage}
The adaptive Revenue strategy consistently supported higher biomass and had
lower N mineralization fluxes at steady state compared to the the non-adaptive
Fixed strategy with the VarN-Incubation scenario (Fig.
\ref{fig:VarNNoFeedback}). Similar patterns appeared with the other scenarios
(Figs. \ref{fig:SimSteady} and \ref{fig:CO2IncreaseImb}). Such better resource
usage is in line with results of individual based small-scale modelling
\citep{Kaiser14}.
The finding implies that N mineralization fluxes with imbalanced resources may
be lower than inferred from previous modelling studies that did not account for
community adaptation.

The SEAM model focuses on community adaptation of enzyme production. It predicts
a change in the ratio of enzyme activities of enzymes degrading C-rich plant
litter versus enzymes degrading the N-rich residue SOM when changing inputs of
inorganic N to the soil.
While low variation in stoichiometry of N-degrading versus C-degrading enzymatic
activity is observed across biomes \citep{Sinsabaugh09}, microcosm studies
detect short-term changes of enzyme activities with N fertilization
\citep{Kumar16}, but their observations differ between different kinds of N-degrading
enzymes. It implies that the simplifying assumptions of the SEAM model are
in line with more detailed models but cannot be directly compared and
validated by observations yet.

\subsection{SOM can store and release N}
Nitrogen was stored in residue SOM during periods of high N inputs and
released during periods of low N inputs relative to C inputs in simulations
(Fig.
\ref{fig:CO2Increase}). When there was excess litter carbon, microbial community
preferentially depolymerized or mined the N rich residue pool and also
made it available for plants by mineralization.
Contrary, when there were low carbon inputs, microbes less strongly degraded the
residue pool but continued to build it via microbial turnover.
Hence, microbes kept N in the system instead of releasing it by mineralization.
This bank mechanism \citep{Perveen14} also worked when simulating the intensive
pasture (Fig. \ref{fig:pastureFit}). During simulations of high inorganic N
inputs, N was sequestered in SOM at a high rate. With decreased inorganic N
inputs, the sequestration rate decreased until it became negative, i.e. the N
in recalcitrat SOM was mined. Ultimately, on the long term, the inputs to the
system have to balance the outputs of the system. In the intensive pasture simulation,
inorganic N pools and N leaching increased with the increase of SOM with the
SEAM model. This finding has consequences on feedbacks of global change, especially
on the projected C land uptake \citep{Friedlingstein14}. When accounting for the
bank mechanisms land carbon sink and plant nutrition will not be as strongly
N-limited.

\subsection{Priming effects recycle N}
Priming effects, i.e. the altered decomposition of SOM after soil amendmends
\citep{Kuzyakov00}, can help plants to stimulate N release for plant nutrition.
Priming effects and associated increased N mineralization were simulated for all
strategies (Fig. \ref{fig:PrimingDec}). With adaptive microbial enzyme
allocation, plant litter inputs influenced the partitioning of SOM between a low
and high C/N pools (Fig. \ref{fig:CO2Increase}) and, hence,
also influenced the distribution of N in the ecosystem and nutrient
availability for plants (Fig. \ref{fig:CO2IncreaseImb}). This active role of
plant inputs has been demonstrated in a soil incubation experiment
\citep{Fontaine11} and has been further conceptualized with the SYMPHONY model
\citep{Perveen14}. Our results are in line with these studies, although our
explanation is on a more abstract level (section \ref{sec:Holistic}). The
conservation or release of N by the bank mechanism implies greater potential
for ecosystems to avoid progressive N limitation \citep{Norby10, Franklin14, Averill15}.

Mineralization during microbial turnover is important for nutrient recycling.
Without the additional mineralization mechanisms of uptake mineralization
\citep{Manzoni08} and turnover mineralization \citep{Clarholm85, Raynaud06} in
our simulation experiment, microbes shifted enzyme allocation to degrade the
residues pool, but the N was fixed in microbial biomass and was not mineralized
to inorganic N. Hence, our experiments reinforced the need for representing soil
heterogeneity and grazing for making N available for plants under N limitation.

\subsection{Mismatch in time scale of priming effects}
The unrealistically long time scale of priming effects in SEAM resulted from
both, the turnover time of enzymes and the positive feedback between amounts of
microbial biomass and enzymes. The time scale of priming effects of several
month in SEAM simulations (Fig. \ref{fig:PrimingDec}) was in contrast with incubation
studies that observe priming effects within days or weeks that rapidly
declined after the amendmend has been used up \citep{Blagodatskaya14}. Here, we
discuss hypotheses of what processes could be reponsible for this mismatch and
need further study.
Priming timescale in SEAM was longer than the duration of the uptake pulse of
the $L$ amendment that only lasted a few days. It was controlled by simulated
enzyme turnover, which SEAM described as first order kinetics with a turnover of
about a week. Moreover, priming timescale was prolonged by the
positive feedback of increased microbial biomass producing more enzymes that
again fueled biomass.

One option to decrease priming timescale in SEAM is a different representation
of enzyme turnover. Prescibing a shorter turnover time of enzymes, however,
would require an increased effort of producing enzymes by microbial biomass.
More sophisticated models of different enzyme turnover kinetics including
stabilization of a part on mineral surfaces \citep{Burns13}, hopefully, will be
able to resolve such contradictions. Testing this hypothesis requires data on
the fraction of uptake allocated to enzyme production and data on age distribution
of enzymes in soil.

An alternative option to decrease priming timescale, is to describe the priming
effect in a different manner. Some enzymes such as peroxidases need to be
fueled by labile OM themselves \citep{Rousk14} with no
immediate relationship to microbial biomass dynamics. This explanation, however, implies that enzyme
activity and decomposition of SOM becomes decoupled from enzyme production and
microbial dynamics to a large extent in the short term.
This option is contrary to the assumption of most current models that simulate
the priming effect. 

Another option to decrease the priming timescale, is to diminish the sustaining
positive feedback between enzymes and microbial biomass. Currently, grazing is
an implicit part of a first order microbial turnover. With increasing microbial
biomass, grazers become more efficient \citep{Clarholm81}. With implementing a
time-lagged stronger increase in microbial turnover rate with microbial biomass,
biomass levels would decrease faster to pre-treatment levels and help to shorten
the time-scale of the priming effect. Testing this hypothesis requires data on
grazing during priming effects.

Overall, the unrealistically simulated priming time scale hints to gaps in
understanding short-term SOM turnover. However, it does not impair the simulated
longer-term microbial community controls on SOM cycling. We argue that the
simulated long-term patterns are robust, because they are more strongly
controlled by the proportions in enzyme production than by the time scale of
priming effects.

\subsection{A holistic view for upscaling}
\label{sec:Holistic}

The presented SEAM model takes a holistic view \citep{Panikov10} of
microbial community and their adaptations instead of explicitely describing
microbial diversity.
In this respect, it differs from the SYMPHONY model \citep{Perveen14} and
similar models \citep{Fontaine03}, that explicitly modelled several
microbial groups.
% specifically SOM builders, that grow solely on fresh low nutrient material
% (here $L$), and SOM builders that can use all the SOM.
The effective behaviour of the presented SEAM model, however, is similar.
It assumes that community composition is driven to a large extent by external
drivers. Specifically, it describes an adaptive allocation
of resources into breakdown of different resources by assuming that the
community composition adapts to changed resource availability in a way to
optimize microbe's revenue.
While the mechanistic approach of the SYMPHONY model explicitly represents this
optimization by shifts between microbial groups, the holistic approach
represents the effects of this optimization at community level.
While the mechanistic approach gives more detailed understanding of the mechanism,
we hypothesize, that the holistic approach is more suitable for upscaling
\citep{Wutzler13}.
Hence, the proposed abstraction of microbial competition by the revenue strategy
is a step forward of better representing couplings of soil carbon and nutrient
cycles in earth system models and a step forward to improved predictions of long
term carbon sequestration.

The holistic SEAM model yielded qualitatively similar predictions as the
mechanistic SYMPHONY model with simulating priming, the bank mechanism, and a
continuous SOM sequestration under high inorganic N inputs. It differed from
SYMPHONY in the prediction of the inorganic N pool during low N inputs.
Specifically, it predicted a decrease in this pool, while SYMPHONY predicted an
increase in this pool due to changed competition \citep{Perveen14}. The
difference is probably caused by different assumptions on how the DOM pool is
shared among groups of the microbial community and resulting different
competition conditions. In the SEAM model, decomposition products become mixed
in a shared DOM pool, while in the SYMPHONY model the decomposition products are
not shared between the microbial groups.
The truth at pore scale is in between, in that decomposition products are mainly
used by the group that is producing the extracellular enzymes, while a part of
the DOM diffuses also to other groups \citep{Kaiser14}. At larger scales, such
details cannot be measured or resolved. The difference in model prediction
implies that the rationality of the simplified model assumptions of a mixed
DOM pool can be qualitatively tested against observations. 

\subsection{Testable predictions of change of SOM C/N ratios}
The SEAM model can be used to predict long term patterns of SOM cycling after
changes in resource stoichiometry. Observations of such pattern provide evidence
for or against the modelling assumptions.
Specifically, SEAM predicted a change in proportions of the litter pool and the
SOM pool (Fig. \ref{fig:CO2Increase}). While these abstract pools are not
directly comparable to observations, a measureable consequence is the associated
change of total SOM C/N ratio at the time scale of turnover of the residue
pool. Specifically, SEAM predicted a decline in SOM stocks and an increase of
SOM C/N with Face experiments at formerly C-limited systems over time scales of
several decades.
 
\subsection{Outlook} 
The biggest limitation of the SEAM model is its focus on a single process:
community adaptation of enzyme allocation. In order to focus, we had to ignore
several other important processes. One such process is the second microbial
community strategy of handling resource stoichiometric imbalance,
the adaption of stoichiometry of microbial biomass. Although the potential of this biomass
adaptation is thought to be quite limited \citep{Mooshammer14}, it will be
tested whether these two strategies can be combined within a model.

Next, the optimality principle will be extended to also determine the proportion
of uptake that is allocated to enzyme production. Presence of cheaters, i.e.
microbes that consume resource but without producing enzymes, effectively lower
the community-level allocation to enzymes \citep{Kaiser14}. Community
development can be assumed to maximise biomass production. Such an assumption
can be used to compute the optimal community enzyme production and allows
exploring effects on SOM cycling, such as more constrained carbon and nutrient
use efficiencies.

Moreover, SEAM will be simplified by assuming quasi-steady state of biomass or
enzyme pools \citep{Wutzler13}. These simplifications will lead to fewer
parameters and improved identifiably in model calibration to observations.
Togehter with implementing the influence of environmental factors such as
temperature and moisture \citep{Davidson12}, these changes will make SEAM more
suitable to be used as a component within larger scale land surface models.
 

\conclusions   
%% \conclusions[modified heading if necessary]
 
Adaptating resources allocation into the production of different
enzymes is an effective means of the microbial community to react to changing
resource stoichiometry. Allocation adaptation strategies helped microbial biomass in SEAM
(Fig. \ref{fig:SEAMStruct}) simulations to grow larger biomass across a wider
range of resource stoichiometry (Fig. \ref{fig:VarNNoFeedback}). Among the
tested strategies, the revenue strategy was particularly successful, which took
into account both, the amount of resource and their stoichiometry.
The findings imply that models that want to simulate soil carbon and nutrients
dynamics (Figs. \ref{fig:PrimingDec} and \ref{fig:PrimingMin}) must account for
adaptations in carbon and nutrient strategies. Accounting for adaptations will
be especially important, when studying the competition for nutrients between
soil microorganism and plants, because SOM can function as a storage to
sequester surplus elements and prevent them from leaving the system (Fig.
\ref{fig:CO2Increase} and \ref{fig:CO2IncreaseImb}).

The SEAM model provides a holistic description of community adaptations. It
yields qualitatively similar predictions as microbial-group-explicit models
with the ability to represent priming effects, bank mechanism, and
a continuous SOM sequestration with high inorganic N inputs (Fig.
\ref{fig:pastureFit}).

Hence, this study provides an important step for providing an abstract
description of microbial community effects and adaptations, with the long-term
goal of including the important mechanisms into earth system models.
